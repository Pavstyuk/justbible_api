Please, let me escape there (is it not small?) so that my life may be saved.”","21":"And he said to him, “Behold, I grant you this request also, not to overthrow the town of which you have spoken.","22":"“Hurry, escape there, for I cannot do anything until you arrive there.” Therefore the town was named Zoar.","23":"The sun had risen over the earth when Lot came to Zoar.","24":"Then the LORD rained brimstone and fire on Sodom and Gomorrah from the LORD out of heaven,","25":"and He overthrew those cities, and all the surrounding area, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and what grew on the ground.","26":"But Lot’s wife, from behind him, looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.","27":"Now Abraham got up early in the morning and went to the place where he had stood before the LORD;","28":"and he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the surrounding area; and behold, he saw the smoke of the land ascended like the smoke of a furnace.","29":"So it came about, when God destroyed the cities of the surrounding area, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the destruction, when He overthrew the cities in which Lot had lived.","30":"Now Lot went up from Zoar with his two daughters and stayed in the mountains, because he was afraid to stay in Zoar; and he stayed in a cave, he and his two daughters.","31":"Then the firstborn said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is not a man on earth to have relations with us according to the custom of all the earth.","32":"“Come, let’s make our father drink wine, and let’s sleep with him so that we may keep our family alive through our father.”","33":"So they made their father drink wine that night, and the firstborn went in and slept with her father; and he did not know when she lay down or got up.","34":"On the following day, the firstborn said to the younger, “Look, I slept last night with my father; let’s make him drink wine tonight too, then you go in and sleep with him, so that we may keep our family alive through our father.”","35":"So they had their father drink wine that night too, and the younger got up and slept with him; and he did not know when she lay down or got up.","36":"And so both of the daughters of Lot conceived by their father.","37":"The firstborn gave birth to a son, and named him Moab; he is the father of the Moabites to this day.","38":"As for the younger, she also gave birth to a son, and named him Ben-ammi; he is the father of the sons of Ammon to this day."},"20":{"1":"Now Abraham journeyed from there toward the land of the Negev, and settled between Kadesh and Shur; then he lived for a time in Gerar.","2":"And Abraham said of his wife Sarah, “She is my sister.” So Abimelech king of Gerar sent men and took Sarah.","3":"But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him, “Behold, you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken, for she is married.”","4":"Now Abimelech had not come near her; and he said, “Lord, will You kill a nation, even though blameless?","5":"“Did he himself not say to me, ‘She is my sister’? And she herself said, ‘He is my brother.’ In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands I have done this.”","6":"Then God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know that in the integrity of your heart you have done this, and I also kept you from sinning against Me; therefore I did not let you touch her.","7":"“Now then, return the man’s wife, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you will live. But if you do not return her, know that you will certainly die, you and all who are yours.”","8":"So Abimelech got up early in the morning and called all his servants, and told all these things in their presence; and the people were greatly frightened.","9":"Then Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, “What have you done to us? And how have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? You have done to me things that ought not to be done.”","10":"And Abimelech said to Abraham, “What have you encountered, that you have done this thing?”","11":"Abraham said, “Because I thought, surely there is no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.","12":"“Besides, she actually is my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife;","13":"and it came about, when God caused me to wander from my father’s house, that I said to her, ‘This is the kindness which you will show to me: everywhere we go, say of me, “He is my brother.”’”","14":"Abimelech then took sheep and oxen and male and female servants, and gave them to Abraham, and returned his wife Sarah to him.","15":"Abimelech said, “Behold, my land is before you; settle wherever you please.”","16":"To Sarah he said, “Look, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. It is your vindication before all who are with you, and before everyone you are cleared.”","17":"Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech and his wife and his female slaves, so that they gave birth to children.","18":"For the LORD had completely closed all the wombs of the household of Abimelech because of Sarah, Abraham’s wife."},"21":{"1":"Then the LORD took note of Sarah as He had said, and the LORD did for Sarah as He had promised.","2":"So Sarah conceived and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the appointed time of which God had spoken to him.","3":"Abraham named his son who was born to him, the son whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac.","4":"Then Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him.","5":"Now Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.","6":"Sarah said, “God has made laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh with me.”","7":"And she said, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have given birth to a son in his old age.”","8":"And the child grew and was weaned, and Abraham held a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.","9":"Now Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking Isaac.","10":"Therefore she said to Abraham, “Drive out this slave woman and her son, for the son of this slave woman shall not be an heir with my son Isaac!”","11":"The matter distressed Abraham greatly because of his son Ishmael.","12":"But God said to Abraham, “Do not be distressed because of the boy and your slave woman; whatever Sarah tells you, listen to her, for through Isaac your descendants shall be named.","13":"“And of the son of the slave woman I will make a nation also, because he is your descendant.”","14":"So Abraham got up early in the morning and took bread and a skin of water, and gave them to Hagar, putting them on her shoulder, and gave her the boy, and sent her away. And she departed and wandered about in the wilderness of Beersheba.","15":"When the water in the skin was used up, she left the boy under one of the bushes.","16":"Then she went and sat down opposite him, about a bowshot away, for she said, “May I not see the boy die!” And she sat opposite him, and raised her voice and wept.","17":"God heard the boy crying; and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, “What is the matter with you, Hagar? Do not fear, for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is.","18":"“Get up, lift up the boy, and hold him by the hand, for I will make a great nation of him.”","19":"Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink.","20":"And God was with the boy, and he grew; and he lived in the wilderness and became an archer.","21":"He lived in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt.","22":"Now it came about at that time that Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, spoke to Abraham, saying, “God is with you in all that you do;","23":"so now, swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me or with my offspring or with my descendants, but according to the kindness that I have shown to you, you shall show to me and to the land in which you have resided.”","24":"Abraham said, “I swear it.”","25":"But Abraham complained to Abimelech because of the well of water which the servants of Abimelech had seized.","26":"And Abimelech said, “I do not know who has done this thing; you did not tell me, nor did I hear of it until today.”","27":"So Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two of them made a covenant.","28":"But Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.","29":"Then Abimelech said to Abraham, “What do these seven ewe lambs mean, which you have set by themselves?”","30":"He said, “You shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand so that it may be a witness for me, that I dug this well.”","31":"Therefore he called that place Beersheba, because there the two of them took an oath.","32":"So they made a covenant at Beersheba; and Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, got up and returned to the land of the Philistines.","33":"Abraham planted a tamarisk tree at Beersheba, and there he called on the name of the LORD, the Everlasting God.","34":"And Abraham resided in the land of the Philistines for many days."},"22":{"1":"Now it came about after these things, that God tested Abraham, and said to him, “Abraham!” And he said, “Here I am.”","2":"Then He said, “Take now your son, your only son, whom you love, Isaac, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I will tell you.”","3":"So Abraham got up early in the morning and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him and his son Isaac; and he split wood for the burnt offering, and set out and went to the place of which God had told him.","4":"On the third day Abraham raised his eyes and saw the place from a distance.","5":"Then Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey, and I and the boy will go over there; and we will worship and return to you.”","6":"And Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and laid it on his son Isaac, and he took in his hand the fire and the knife. So the two of them walked on together.","7":"Isaac spoke to his father Abraham and said, “My father!” And he said, “Here I am, my son.” And he said, “Look, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?”","8":"Abraham said, “God will provide for Himself the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.” So the two of them walked on together.","9":"Then they came to the place of which God had told him; and Abraham built the altar there and arranged the wood, and bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood.","10":"And Abraham reached out with his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son.","11":"But the angel of the LORD called to him from heaven and said, “Abraham, Abraham!” And he said, “Here I am.”","12":"He said, “Do not reach out your hand against the boy, and do not do anything to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from Me.”","13":"Then Abraham raised his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him was a ram caught in the thicket by its horns; and Abraham went and took the ram and offered it up as a burnt offering in the place of his son.","14":"And Abraham named that place The LORD Will Provide, as it is said to this day, “On the mountain of the LORD it will be provided.”","15":"Then the angel of the LORD called to Abraham a second time from heaven,","16":"and said, “By Myself I have sworn, declares the LORD, because you have done this thing and have not withheld your son, your only son,","17":"indeed I will greatly bless you, and I will greatly multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens and as the sand, which is on the seashore; and your seed shall possess the gate of their enemies.","18":"“And in your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, because you have obeyed My voice.”","19":"So Abraham returned to his young men, and they got up and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham lived in Beersheba.","20":"Now it came about after these things, that Abraham was told, saying, “Behold, Milcah also has borne children to your brother Nahor:","21":"Uz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel (the father of Aram),","22":"Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel”—","23":"and it was Bethuel who fathered Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham’s brother.","24":"His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also gave birth to Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah."},"23":{"1":"Now Sarah lived 127 years; these were the years of the life of Sarah.","2":"Sarah died in Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan; and Abraham came in to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her.","3":"Then Abraham arose from mourning before his dead, and spoke to the sons of Heth, saying,","4":"“I am a stranger and a foreign resident among you; give me a burial site among you so that I may bury my dead out of my sight.”","5":"The sons of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him,","6":"“Hear us, my lord: you are a mighty prince among us; bury your dead in the choicest of our graves; none of us will refuse you his grave for burying your dead.”","7":"So Abraham stood up and bowed to the people of the land, the sons of Heth.","8":"And he spoke with them, saying, “If you are willing to let me bury my dead out of my sight, listen to me, and plead with Ephron the son of Zohar for me,","9":"that he may give me the cave of Machpelah which he owns, which is at the end of his field; for the full price let him give it to me in your presence for a burial site.”","10":"Now Ephron was sitting among the sons of Heth; and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham so that the sons of Heth heard, that is, all who entered the gate of his city, saying,","11":"“No, my lord, listen to me; I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. In the presence of the sons of my people I give it to you; bury your dead.”","12":"And Abraham bowed before the people of the land.","13":"But he spoke to Ephron so that the people of the land heard, saying, “If you will only please listen to me; I will give the price of the field, accept it from me so that I may bury my dead there.”","14":"Then Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him,","15":"“My lord, listen to me: a plot of land worth four hundred shekels of silver—what is that between me and you? So bury your dead.”","16":"Abraham listened to Ephron; and Abraham weighed out for Ephron the silver which he had named in the presence of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, currency acceptable to a merchant.","17":"So Ephron’s field, which was in Machpelah, which faced Mamre, the field and the cave which was in it, and all the trees which were in the field, that were within all the confines of its border, were deeded over","18":"to Abraham as a possession in the presence of the sons of Heth, before all who entered the gate of his city.","19":"After this, Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave of the field of Machpelah facing Mamre (that is, Hebron), in the land of Canaan.","20":"So the field and the cave that was in it were deeded over to Abraham for a burial site by the sons of Heth."},"24":{"1":"Now Abraham was old, advanced in age; and the LORD had blessed Abraham in every way.","2":"Abraham said to his servant, the oldest of his household who was in charge of all that he owned, “Please place your hand under my thigh,","3":"and I will make you swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and the God of earth, that you shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I live;","4":"but you will go to my country and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son Isaac.”","5":"The servant said to him, “Suppose the woman is not willing to follow me to this land; should I take your son back to the land from where you came?”","6":"Then Abraham said to him, “Beware that you do not take my son back there!","7":"“The LORD, the God of heaven, who took me from my father’s house and from the land of my birth, and who spoke to me and who swore to me, saying, ‘To your descendants I will give this land’—He will send His angel ahead of you, and you will take a wife for my son from there.","8":"“But if the woman is not willing to follow you, then you will be free of this oath of mine; only do not take my son back there.”","9":"So the servant placed his hand under the thigh of his master Abraham, and swore to him concerning this matter.","10":"Then the servant took ten camels from the camels of his master, and went out with a variety of good things of his master’s in his hand; so he set out and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.","11":"He made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water when it was evening, the time when women go out to draw water.","12":"And he said, “LORD, God of my master Abraham, please grant me success today, and show kindness to my master Abraham.","13":"“Behold, I am standing by the spring, and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water;","14":"now may it be that the young woman to whom I say, ‘Please let down your jar so that I may drink,’ and who answers, ‘Drink, and I will water your camels also’—may she be the one whom You have appointed for Your servant Isaac; and by this I will know that You have shown kindness to my master.”","15":"And it came about, before he had finished speaking, that behold, Rebekah, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Abraham’s brother Nahor, came out with her jar on her shoulder.","16":"The young woman was very beautiful, a virgin; no man had had relations with her. She went down to the spring, filled her jar, and came up.","17":"Then the servant ran to meet her, and said, “Please let me drink a little water from your jar.”","18":"And she said, “Drink, my lord”; then she quickly lowered her jar to her hand, and gave him a drink.","19":"Now when she had finished giving him a drink, she said, “I will also draw water for your camels until they have finished drinking.”","20":"So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough, and ran back to the well to draw, and she drew for all his camels.","21":"Meanwhile, the man was taking a close look at her in silence, to find out whether the LORD had made his journey successful or not.","22":"When the camels had finished drinking, the man took a gold ring weighing a half-shekel, and two bracelets for her wrists weighing ten shekels in gold,","23":"and he said, “Whose daughter are you? Please tell me, is there room for us to stay overnight at your father’s house?”","24":"She said to him, “I am the daughter of Bethuel, Milcah’s son, whom she bore to Nahor.”","25":"Again she said to him, “We have plenty of both straw and feed, and room to stay overnight.”","26":"Then the man bowed low and worshiped the LORD.","27":"And he said, “Blessed be the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has not abandoned His kindness and His trustworthiness toward my master; as for me, the LORD has guided me in the way to the house of my master’s brothers.”","28":"Then the young woman ran and told her mother’s household about these things.","29":"Now Rebekah had a brother whose name was Laban; and Laban ran outside to the man at the spring.","30":"When he saw the ring and the bracelets on his sister’s wrists, and when he heard the words of his sister Rebekah, saying, “This is what the man said to me,” he went to the man; and behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring.","31":"And he said, “Come in, blessed of the LORD! Why do you stand outside, since I have prepared the house, and a place for the camels?”","32":"So the man entered the house. Then Laban unloaded the camels, and he gave straw and feed to the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.","33":"But when food was set before him to eat, he said, “I will not eat until I have stated my business.” And he said, “Speak on.”","34":"So he said, “I am Abraham’s servant.","35":"“The LORD has greatly blessed my master, so that he has become rich; and He has given him flocks and herds, and silver and gold, and servants and slave women, and camels and donkeys.","36":"“Now my master’s wife Sarah bore a son to my master in her old age, and he has given him all that he has.","37":"“My master made me swear, saying, ‘You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live;","38":"but you shall go to my father’s house and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son.’","39":"“Then I said to my master, ‘Suppose the woman does not follow me.’","40":"“And he said to me, ‘The LORD, before whom I have walked, will send His angel with you to make your journey successful, and you will take a wife for my son from my relatives and from my father’s house;","41":"then you will be free from my oath, when you come to my relatives; and if they do not give her to you, you will be free from my oath.’","42":"“So I came today to the spring, and said, ‘LORD, God of my master Abraham, if now You will make my journey on which I have been going successful;","43":"behold, I am standing by the spring, and may it be that the young unmarried woman who comes out to draw water, and to whom I say, “Please let me drink a little water from your jar”;","44":"and she says to me, “You drink, and I will draw for your camels also”—let her be the woman whom the LORD has appointed for my master’s son.’","45":"“Before I had finished speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder, and went down to the spring and drew water, and I said to her, ‘Please let me drink.’","46":"“She quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder, and said, ‘Drink, and I will water your camels also’; so I drank, and she watered the camels also.","47":"“Then I asked her, and said, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ And she said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bore to him’; and I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her wrists.","48":"“And I bowed low and worshiped the LORD, and blessed the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who had guided me in the right way to take the daughter of my master’s brother for his son.","49":"“So now if you are going to deal kindly and truthfully with my master, tell me; and if not, tell me now, so that I may turn to the right or the left.”","50":"Then Laban and Bethuel replied, “The matter has come from the LORD; so we cannot speak to you bad or good.","51":"“Here is Rebekah before you, take her and go, and let her be the wife of your master’s son, as the LORD has spoken.”","52":"When Abraham’s servant heard their words, he bowed himself to the ground before the LORD.","53":"And the servant brought out articles of silver and articles of gold, and garments, and gave them to Rebekah; he also gave precious things to her brother and to her mother.","54":"Then he and the men who were with him ate and drank and spent the night. When they got up in the morning, he said, “Send me away to my master.”","55":"But her brother and her mother said, “Let the young woman stay with us a few days, say ten; afterward she may go.”","56":"However, he said to them, “Do not delay me, since the LORD has prospered my way. Send me away so that I may go to my master.”","57":"And they said, “We will call the young woman and ask her.”","58":"Then they called Rebekah and said to her, “Will you go with this man?” And she said, “I will go.”","59":"So they sent away their sister Rebekah and her nurse with Abraham’s servant and his men.","60":"And they blessed Rebekah and said to her,\n“May you, our sister,\nBecome thousands of ten thousands,\nAnd may your descendants possess\nThe gate of those who hate them.”","61":"Then Rebekah got up with her female attendants, and they mounted the camels and followed the man. So the servant took Rebekah and departed.","62":"Now Isaac had come back from a journey to Beer-lahai-roi; for he was living in the Negev.","63":"Isaac went out to meditate in the field toward evening; and he raised his eyes and looked, and behold, camels were coming.","64":"Rebekah raised her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she dismounted from the camel.","65":"She said to the servant, “Who is that man walking in the field to meet us?” And the servant said, “He is my master.” Then she took her veil and covered herself.","66":"The servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.","67":"Then Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and he took Rebekah, and she became his wife, and he loved her; so Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death."},"25":{"1":"Now Abraham took another wife, whose name was Keturah.","2":"She bore to him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.","3":"Jokshan fathered Sheba and Dedan.

And the LORD blessed him,","13":"and the man became rich, and continued to grow richer until he became very wealthy;","14":"for he had possessions of flocks and herds, and a great household, so that the Philistines envied him.","15":"Now all the wells which his father’s servants had dug in the days of his father Abraham, the Philistines stopped up by filling them with dirt.","16":"Then Abimelech said to Isaac, “Go away from us, for you are too powerful for us.”","17":"So Isaac departed from there and camped in the Valley of Gerar, and settled there.","18":"Then Isaac dug again the wells of water which had been dug in the days of his father Abraham, for the Philistines had stopped them up after the death of Abraham; and he gave them the same names which his father had given them.","19":"But when Isaac’s servants dug in the valley and found there a well of flowing water,","20":"the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with the herdsmen of Isaac, saying, “The water is ours!” So he named the well Esek, because they argued with him.","21":"Then they dug another well, and they quarreled over it too, so he named it Sitnah.","22":"Then he moved away from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it; so he named it Rehoboth, for he said, “At last the LORD has made room for us, and we will be fruitful in the land.”","23":"And he went up from there to Beersheba.","24":"And the LORD appeared to him the same night and said,\n“I am the God of your father Abraham;\nDo not fear, for I am with you.\nI will bless you and multiply your descendants,\nFor the sake of My servant Abraham.”","25":"So he built an altar there and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there; and there Isaac’s servants dug a well.","26":"Then Abimelech came to him from Gerar with his adviser Ahuzzath, and Phicol the commander of his army.","27":"Isaac said to them, “Why have you come to me, since you hate me and have sent me away from you?”","28":"They said, “We have seen plainly that the LORD has been with you; so we said, ‘An oath must now be taken by us,’ that is, by you and us. So let us make a covenant with you,","29":"that you will do us no harm, just as we have not touched you and have done to you nothing but good, and have sent you away in peace. You are now the blessed of the LORD.”","30":"Then he made them a feast, and they ate and drank.","31":"In the morning they got up early and exchanged oaths; then Isaac sent them away, and they left him in peace.","32":"Now it came about on the same day, that Isaac’s servants came in and told him about the well which they had dug, and said to him, “We have found water.”","33":"So he called it Shibah; therefore the name of the city is Beersheba to this day.","34":"When Esau was forty years old he married Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite;","35":"and they brought grief to Isaac and Rebekah."},"27":{"1":"Now it came about, when Isaac was old and his eyes were too dim to see, that he called his older son Esau and said to him, “My son.” And he said to him, “Here I am.”","2":"Then Isaac said, “Behold now, I am old and I do not know the day of my death.","3":"“Now then, please take your gear, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt game for me;","4":"and prepare a delicious meal for me such as I love, and bring it to me that I may eat, so that my soul may bless you before I die.”","5":"Now Rebekah was listening while Isaac spoke to his son Esau. So when Esau went to the field to hunt for game to bring home,","6":"Rebekah said to her son Jacob, “Behold, I heard your father speak to your brother Esau, saying,","7":"‘Bring me some game and prepare a delicious meal for me, so that I may eat, and bless you in the presence of the LORD before my death.’","8":"“So now, my son, listen to me as I command you.","9":"“Go now to the flock and bring me two choice young goats from there, so that I may prepare them as a delicious meal for your father, such as he loves.","10":"“Then you shall bring it to your father, that he may eat, so that he may bless you before his death.”","11":"But Jacob said to his mother Rebekah, “Behold, my brother Esau is a hairy man and I am a smooth man.","12":"“Perhaps my father will touch me, then I will be like a deceiver in his sight, and I will bring upon myself a curse and not a blessing.”","13":"But his mother said to him, “Your curse be on me, my son; only obey my voice, and go, get the goats for me.”","14":"So he went and got them, and brought them to his mother; and his mother made a delicious meal such as his father loved.","15":"Then Rebekah took the best garments of her elder son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them on her younger son Jacob.","16":"And she put the skins of the young goats on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck.","17":"She also gave the delicious meal and the bread which she had made to her son Jacob.","18":"Then he came to his father and said, “My father.” And he said, “Here I am. Who are you, my son?”","19":"Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau your firstborn; I have done as you told me. Come now, sit and eat of my game, so that you may bless me.”","20":"Isaac said to his son, “How is it that you have it so quickly, my son?” And he said, “Because the LORD your God made it come to me.”","21":"Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Please come close, so that I may feel you, my son, whether you are really my son Esau or not.”","22":"So Jacob came close to his father Isaac, and he touched him and said, “The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau.”","23":"And he did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau’s hands; so he blessed him.","24":"And he said, “Are you really my son Esau?” And he said, “I am.”","25":"So he said, “Bring it to me, and I will eat of my son’s game, that I may bless you.” And he brought it to him, and he ate; he also brought him wine and he drank.","26":"Then his father Isaac said to him, “Please come close and kiss me, my son.”","27":"So he came close and kissed him; and when he smelled the smell of his garments, he blessed him and said,\n“See, the smell of my son\nIs like the smell of a field which the LORD has blessed;","28":"Now may God give you of the dew of heaven,\nAnd of the fatness of the earth,\nAnd an abundance of grain and new wine;","29":"May peoples serve you,\nAnd nations bow down to you;\nBe master of your brothers,\nAnd may your mother’s sons bow down to you.\nCursed be those who curse you,\nAnd blessed be those who bless you.”","30":"Now it came about, as soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, and Jacob had hardly gone out from the presence of his father Isaac, that his brother Esau came in from his hunting.","31":"Then he also made a delicious meal, and brought it to his father; and he said to his father, “Let my father arise and eat of his son’s game, that you may bless me.”","32":"His father Isaac said to him, “Who are you?” And he said, “I am your son, your firstborn, Esau.”","33":"Then Isaac trembled violently, and said, “Who then was he who hunted game and brought it to me, so that I ate from all of it before you came, and blessed him? Yes, and he shall be blessed.”","34":"When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried out with an exceedingly great and bitter cry, and said to his father, “Bless me, me as well, my father!”","35":"And he said, “Your brother came deceitfully and has taken away your blessing.”","36":"Then Esau said, “Is he not rightly named Jacob, for he has betrayed me these two times? He took away my birthright, and behold, now he has taken away my blessing.” And he said, “Have you not reserved a blessing for me?”","37":"But Isaac replied to Esau, “Behold, I have made him your master, and I have given to him all his relatives as servants; and with grain and new wine I have sustained him. What then can I do for you, my son?”","38":"Esau said to his father, “Do you have only one blessing, my father? Bless me, me as well, my father.” So Esau raised his voice and wept.","39":"Then his father Isaac answered and said to him,\n“Behold, away from the fertility of the earth shall be your dwelling,\nAnd away from the dew of heaven from above.","40":"“And by your sword you shall live,\nAnd you shall serve your brother;\nBut it shall come about when you become restless,\nThat you will break his yoke from your neck.”","41":"So Esau held a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him; and Esau said to himself, “The days of mourning for my father are near; then I will kill my brother Jacob.”","42":"Now when the words of her elder son Esau were reported to Rebekah, she sent word and called her younger son Jacob, and said to him, “Behold your brother Esau is consoling himself concerning you by planning to kill you.","43":"“Now then, my son, obey my voice, and arise, flee to Haran, to my brother Laban!","44":"“Stay with him a few days, until your brother’s fury subsides,","45":"until your brother’s anger against you subsides and he forgets what you did to him. Then I will send word and get you from there. Why should I lose you both in one day?”","46":"And Rebekah said to Isaac, “I am tired of living because of the daughters of Heth; if Jacob takes a wife from the daughters of Heth like these from the daughters of the land, what good will my life be to me?”"},"28":{"1":"So Isaac called Jacob and blessed him and commanded him, saying to him, “You shall not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan.","2":"“Arise, go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel your mother’s father; and from there take to yourself a wife from the daughters of Laban, your mother’s brother.","3":"“May God Almighty bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you, so that you may become a multitude of peoples.","4":"“May He also give you the blessing of Abraham, to you and to your descendants with you, so that you may possess the land where you live as a stranger, which God gave to Abraham.”","5":"Then Isaac sent Jacob away, and he went to Paddan-aram to Laban, son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau.","6":"Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan-aram to take to himself a wife from there, and that when he blessed him he commanded him, saying, “You shall not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan,”","7":"and that Jacob had obeyed his father and his mother and had gone to Paddan-aram.","8":"So Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan displeased his father Isaac;","9":"and Esau went to Ishmael, and married, besides the wives that he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, the sister of Nebaioth.","10":"Then Jacob departed from Beersheba and went toward Haran.","11":"And he happened upon a particular place and spent the night there, because the sun had set; and he took one of the stones of the place and made it a support for his head, and lay down in that place.","12":"And he had a dream, and behold, a ladder was set up on the earth with its top reaching to heaven; and behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.","13":"Then behold, the LORD was standing above it and said, “I am the LORD, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac; the land on which you lie I will give to you and to your descendants.","14":"“Your descendants will also be like the dust of the earth, and you will spread out to the west and to the east, and to the north and to the south; and in you and in your descendants shall all the families of the earth be blessed.","15":"“Behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land; for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.”","16":"Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, “The LORD is certainly in this place, and I did not know it!”","17":"And he was afraid and said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven!”","18":"So Jacob got up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had placed as a support for his head, and set it up as a memorial stone, and poured oil on its top.","19":"Then he named that place Bethel; but previously the name of the city had been Luz.","20":"Jacob also made a vow, saying, “If God will be with me and will keep me on this journey that I take, and give me food to eat and garments to wear,","21":"and I return to my father’s house in safety, then the LORD will be my God.","22":"“And this stone, which I have set up as a memorial stone, will be God’s house, and of everything that You give me I will assuredly give a tenth to You.”"},"29":{"1":"Then Jacob set out on his journey, and went to the land of the people of the east.","2":"He looked, and saw a well in the field, and behold, three flocks of sheep were lying there beside it, because they watered the flocks from that well. Now the stone on the mouth of the well was large.","3":"When all the flocks were gathered there, they would roll the stone from the mouth of the well and water the sheep. Then they would put the stone back in its place on the mouth of the well.","4":"Jacob said to them, “My brothers, where are you from?” And they said, “We are from Haran.”","5":"So he said to them, “Do you know Laban the son of Nahor?” And they said, “We know him.”","6":"And he said to them, “Is it well with him?” And they said, “It is well, and here is his daughter Rachel coming with the sheep.”","7":"Then he said, “Look, it is still high day; it is not time for the livestock to be gathered. Water the sheep, and go, pasture them.”","8":"But they said, “We cannot, until all the flocks are gathered, and they roll the stone from the mouth of the well; then we water the sheep.”","9":"While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep, for she was a shepherdess.","10":"When Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of his mother’s brother Laban, and the sheep of his mother’s brother Laban, Jacob went up and rolled the stone from the mouth of the well, and watered the flock of his mother’s brother Laban.","11":"Then Jacob kissed Rachel, and raised his voice and wept.","12":"Jacob told Rachel that he was a relative of her father and that he was Rebekah’s son, and she ran and told her father.","13":"So when Laban heard the news about Jacob, his sister’s son, he ran to meet him, and embraced him and kissed him, and brought him to his house. Then he told Laban all these things.","14":"And Laban said to him, “You certainly are my bone and my flesh.” And he stayed with him a month.","15":"Then Laban said to Jacob, “Because you are my relative, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what shall your wages be?”","16":"Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.","17":"And Leah’s eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful in figure and appearance.","18":"Now Jacob loved Rachel, so he said, “I will serve you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel.”","19":"Laban said, “It is better that I give her to you than to give her to another man; stay with me.”","20":"So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed to him like only a few days because of his love for her.","21":"Then Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife, for my time is completed, that I may have relations with her.”","22":"So Laban gathered all the people of the place and held a feast.","23":"Now in the evening he took his daughter Leah and brought her to him; and Jacob had relations with her.","24":"Laban also gave his female slave Zilpah to his daughter Leah as a slave.","25":"So it came about in the morning that, behold, it was Leah! And he said to Laban, “What is this that you have done to me? Was it not for Rachel that I served with you? Why then have you deceived me?”","26":"But Laban said, “It is not the practice in our place to marry off the younger before the firstborn.","27":"“Complete the week of this one, and we will give you the other also for the service which you shall serve with me, for another seven years.”","28":"Jacob did so and completed her week, and he gave him his daughter Rachel as his wife.","29":"Laban also gave his female slave Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her slave.","30":"So Jacob had relations with Rachel also, and indeed he loved Rachel more than Leah, and he served with Laban for another seven years.","31":"Now the LORD saw that Leah was unloved, and He opened her womb, but Rachel was unable to have children.","32":"Leah conceived and gave birth to a son, and named him Reuben, for she said, “Because the LORD has seen my affliction; surely now my husband will love me.”","33":"Then she conceived again and gave birth to a son, and said, “Because the LORD has heard that I am unloved, He has therefore given me this son also.” So she named him Simeon.","34":"And she conceived again and gave birth to a son, and said, “Now this time my husband will become attached to me, because I have borne him three sons.” Therefore he was named Levi.","35":"And she conceived again and gave birth to a son, and said, “This time I will praise the LORD.” Therefore she named him Judah. Then she stopped having children."},"30":{"1":"Now when Rachel saw that she had not borne Jacob any children, she became jealous of her sister; and she said to Jacob, “Give me children, or else I am going to die.”","2":"Then Jacob’s anger burned against Rachel, and he said, “Am I in the place of God, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?”","3":"Then she said, “Here is my female slave Bilhah: have relations with her that she may give birth on my knees, so that by her I too may obtain a child.”","4":"So she gave him her slave Bilhah as a wife, and Jacob had relations with her.","5":"Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son.","6":"Then Rachel said, “God has vindicated me, and has indeed heard my voice and has given me a son.” Therefore she named him Dan.","7":"And Rachel’s slave Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son.","8":"So Rachel said, “With mighty wrestling I have wrestled with my sister, and I have indeed prevailed.” And she named him Naphtali.","9":"When Leah saw that she had stopped having children, she took her slave Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as a wife.","10":"And Leah’s slave Zilpah bore Jacob a son.","11":"Then Leah said, “How fortunate!” So she named him Gad.","12":"And Leah’s slave Zilpah bore Jacob a second son.","13":"Then Leah said, “Happy am I! For women will call me happy.” So she named him Asher.","14":"Now in the days of wheat harvest Reuben went and found mandrake fruits in the field, and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, “Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.”","15":"But she said to her, “Is it a small matter for you to take my husband? And would you take my son’s mandrakes also?” So Rachel said, “Therefore he may sleep with you tonight in return for your son’s mandrakes.”","16":"When Jacob came in from the field in the evening, Leah went out to meet him and said, “You must have relations with me, for I have indeed hired you with my son’s mandrakes.” So he slept with her that night.","17":"God listened to Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son.","18":"Then Leah said, “God has given me my reward, because I gave my slave to my husband.” So she named him Issachar.","19":"And Leah conceived again and bore a sixth son to Jacob.","20":"Then Leah said, “God has endowed me with a good gift; finally my husband will acknowledge me as his wife, because I have borne him six sons.” So she named him Zebulun.","21":"Afterward she gave birth to a daughter, and named her Dinah.","22":"Then God remembered Rachel, and God listened to her and opened her womb.","23":"So she conceived and gave birth to a son, and said, “God has taken away my disgrace.”","24":"And she named him Joseph, saying, “May the LORD give me another son.”","25":"Now it came about, when Rachel had given birth to Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, “Send me away, so that I may go to my own place and to my own country.","26":"“Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, and let me go; for you yourself know my service which I have rendered you.”","27":"But Laban said to him, “If it pleases you at all, stay with me; I have determined by divination that the LORD has blessed me on your account.”","28":"He continued, “Name me your wages, and I will give them.”","29":"But Jacob said to him, “You yourself know how I have served you and how your livestock have fared with me.","30":"“For you had little before I came, and it has increased to a multitude, and the LORD has blessed you wherever I turned. But now, when shall I provide for my own household also?”","31":"So he said, “What shall I give you?” And Jacob said, “You shall not give me anything. If you will do this one thing for me, I will again pasture and keep your flock:","32":"let me pass through your entire flock today, removing from there every speckled or spotted sheep and every black sheep among the lambs, and the spotted or speckled among the goats; and those shall be my wages.","33":"“So my honesty will answer for me later, when you come concerning my wages. Every one that is not speckled or spotted among the goats, or black among the lambs, if found with me, will be considered stolen.”","34":"Laban said, “Good, let it be according to your word.”","35":"So he removed on that day the striped or spotted male goats, and all the speckled or spotted female goats, every one with white on it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and put them in the care of his sons.","36":"And he put a distance of three days’ journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob fed the rest of Laban’s flocks.","37":"Then Jacob took fresh rods of poplar, almond, and plane trees, and peeled white stripes in them, exposing the white that was in the rods.","38":"He set the rods which he had peeled in front of the flocks in the drinking troughs, that is, in the watering channels where the flocks came to drink; and they mated when they came to drink.","39":"So the flocks mated by the rods, and the flocks delivered striped, speckled, and spotted offspring.","40":"Then Jacob separated the lambs, and made the flocks face toward the striped and all the black in the flock of Laban; and he put his own herds apart, and did not put them with Laban’s flock.","41":"Moreover, whenever the stronger of the flock were mating, Jacob would place the rods in the sight of the flock in the drinking troughs, so that they would mate by the rods;","42":"but when the flock was sickly, he did not put them in; so the sickly were Laban’s, and the stronger were Jacob’s.","43":"So the man became exceedingly prosperous, and had large flocks, and female and male servants, and camels and donkeys."},"31":{"1":"Now Jacob heard the words of Laban’s sons, saying, “Jacob has taken away all that was our father’s, and from what belonged to our father he has made all this wealth.”","2":"And Jacob saw the attitude of Laban, and behold, it was not friendly toward him as it had been before.","3":"Then the LORD said to Jacob, “Return to the land of your fathers and to your relatives, and I will be with you.”","4":"So Jacob sent word and called Rachel and Leah to his flock in the field,","5":"and said to them, “I see your father’s attitude, that it is not friendly toward me as it was before, but the God of my father has been with me.","6":"“You know that I have served your father with all my strength.","7":"“Yet your father has cheated me and changed my wages ten times; however, God did not allow him to do me harm.","8":"“If he said this: ‘The speckled shall be your wages,’ then all the flock delivered speckled; and if he said this: ‘The striped shall be your wages,’ then all the flock delivered striped.","9":"“So God has taken away your father’s livestock and given them to me.","10":"“And it came about at the time when the flock was breeding that I raised my eyes and saw in a dream—and behold—the male goats that were mating were striped, speckled, or mottled.","11":"“Then the angel of God said to me in the dream, ‘Jacob’; and I said, ‘Here I am.’","12":"“He said, ‘Now raise your eyes and see that all the male goats that are mating are striped, speckled, or mottled; for I have seen everything that Laban has been doing to you.","13":"‘I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a memorial stone, where you made a vow to Me; now arise, leave this land, and return to the land of your birth.’”","14":"Rachel and Leah said to him, “Do we still have any share or inheritance in our father’s house?","15":"“Are we not regarded by him as foreigners? For he has sold us, and has also entirely consumed our purchase price.","16":"“Surely all the wealth which God has taken away from our father belongs to us and our children; now then, do whatever God has told you.”","17":"Then Jacob stood up and put his children and his wives on camels;","18":"and he drove away all his livestock and all his property which he had acquired, the livestock he possessed which he had acquired in Paddan-aram, to go to the land of Canaan to his father Isaac.","19":"Laban had gone to shear his flock, and Rachel stole the household idols that were her father’s.","20":"And Jacob deceived Laban the Aramean by not telling him that he was fleeing.","21":"So he fled with all that he had; and he got up and crossed the Euphrates River, and set out for the hill country of Gilead.","22":"When Laban was informed on the third day that Jacob had fled,","23":"he took his kinsmen with him and pursued him a distance of seven days’ journey, and he overtook him in the hill country of Gilead.","24":"However, God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream of the night and said to him, “Be careful that you do not speak to Jacob either good or bad.”","25":"And Laban caught up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country, and Laban with his kinsmen camped in the hill country of Gilead.","26":"Then Laban said to Jacob, “What have you done by deceiving me and carrying away my daughters like captives of the sword?","27":"“Why did you flee secretly and deceive me, and did not tell me, so that I might have sent you away with joy and with songs, with tambourine and with lyre;","28":"and did not allow me to kiss my grandchildren and my daughters? Now you have done foolishly.","29":"“It is in my power to do you harm, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, ‘Be careful not to speak either good or bad to Jacob.’","30":"“Now you have indeed gone away because you longed greatly for your father’s house; but why did you steal my gods?”","31":"Then Jacob replied to Laban, “Because I was afraid, for I thought that you would take your daughters from me by force.","32":"“The one with whom you find your gods shall not live; in the presence of our relatives point out what is yours among my belongings and take it for yourself.” Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.","33":"So Laban went into Jacob’s tent, and into Leah’s tent, and into the tent of the two slave women, but he did not find them. Then he went out of Leah’s tent and entered Rachel’s tent.","34":"Now Rachel had taken the household idols and put them in the camel’s saddlebag, and she sat on them. So Laban searched through all the tent, but did not find them.","35":"And she said to her father, “May my lord not be angry that I cannot stand in your presence, because the way of women is upon me.” So he searched but did not find the household idols.","36":"Then Jacob became angry and argued with Laban; and Jacob said to Laban, “What is my offense? What is my sin that you have hotly pursued me?","37":"“Though you have searched through all my property, what have you found of all your household property? Set it here in front of my relatives and your relatives, so that they may decide between the two of us.","38":"“For these twenty years I have been with you; your ewes and your female goats have not miscarried, nor have I eaten the rams of your flocks.","39":"“I did not even bring to you that which was torn by wild animals; I took the loss myself. You demanded it of my hand whether stolen by day or stolen by night.","40":"“This is how I was: by day the heat consumed me and the frost by night, and my sleep fled from my eyes.","41":"“For these twenty years I have been in your house; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you changed my wages ten times.","42":"“If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the fear of Isaac, had not been for me, surely now you would have sent me away empty-handed. God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands, so He rendered judgment last night.”","43":"Then Laban replied to Jacob, “The daughters are my daughters, the children are my grandchildren, the flocks are my flocks, and everything that you see is mine. But what can I do this day to these daughters of mine or to their children to whom they have given birth?","44":"“So now come, let’s make a covenant, you and I, and it shall be a witness between you and me.”","45":"Then Jacob took a stone and set it up as a memorial stone.","46":"Jacob said to his relatives, “Gather stones.” So they took stones and made a heap, and they ate there by the heap.","47":"Now Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed.","48":"Laban said, “This heap is a witness between you and me this day.” Therefore it was named Galeed,","49":"and Mizpah, for he said, “May the LORD keep watch between you and me when we are absent one from the other.","50":"“If you mistreat my daughters, or if you take wives besides my daughters, although no one is with us, see, God is witness between you and me.”","51":"Laban also said to Jacob, “Behold this heap and behold the memorial stone which I have set between you and me.","52":"“This heap is a witness, and the memorial stone is a witness, that I will not pass by this heap to you for harm, and you will not pass by this heap and this memorial stone to me, for harm.","53":"“The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us.” So Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac.","54":"Then Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain, and called his relatives to the meal; and they ate the meal and spent the night on the mountain.","55":"Then early in the morning Laban got up, and kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them. Then Laban departed and returned to his place."},"32":{"1":"Now as Jacob went on his way, the angels of God met him.","2":"And when he saw them, Jacob said, “This is God’s camp.” So he named that place Mahanaim.","3":"Then Jacob sent messengers ahead of himself to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom.","4":"He commanded them, saying, “This is what you shall say to my lord Esau: ‘Your servant Jacob says the following: “I have resided with Laban, and stayed until now;","5":"and I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, and male and female servants; and I have sent messengers to tell my lord, so that I may find favor in your sight.”’”","6":"And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, “We came to your brother Esau, and furthermore he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him.”","7":"Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed; and he divided the people who were with him, and the flocks, the herds, and the camels, into two companies;","8":"for he said, “If Esau comes to the one company and attacks it, then the company which is left will escape.”","9":"Then Jacob said, “God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, LORD, who said to me, ‘Return to your country and to your relatives, and I will make you prosper,’","10":"I am unworthy of all the favor and of all the faithfulness, which You have shown to Your servant; for with only my staff I crossed this Jordan, and now I have become two companies.","11":"“Save me, please, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him, that he will come and attack me and the mothers with the children.","12":"“For You said, ‘I will assuredly make you prosper and make your descendants as the sand of the sea, which is too great to be counted.’”","13":"So he spent the night there. Then he selected from what he had with him a gift for his brother Esau:","14":"two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,","15":"thirty milking camels and their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, and twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.","16":"Then he placed them in the care of his servants, every flock by itself, and said to his servants, “Pass on ahead of me, and put a space between flocks.”","17":"And he commanded the one in front, saying, “When my brother Esau meets you and asks you, saying, ‘To whom do you belong, and where are you going, and to whom do these animals in front of you belong?’","18":"then you shall say, ‘These belong to your servant Jacob; it is a gift sent to my lord Esau. And behold, he also is behind us.’”","19":"Then he commanded also the second and the third, and all those who followed the flocks, saying, “In this way you shall speak to Esau when you find him;","20":"and you shall say, ‘Behold, your servant Jacob also is behind us.’” For he said, “I will appease him with the gift that goes ahead of me. Then afterward I will see his face; perhaps he will accept me.”","21":"So the gift passed on ahead of him, while he himself spent that night in the camp.","22":"Now he got up that same night and took his two wives, his two female slaves, and his eleven children, and crossed the shallow place of the Jabbok.","23":"He took them and sent them across the stream. And he sent across whatever he had.","24":"Then Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him until daybreak.","25":"When the man saw that he had not prevailed against him, he touched the socket of Jacob’s hip; and the socket of Jacob’s hip was dislocated while he wrestled with him.","26":"Then he said, “Let me go, for the dawn is breaking.” But he said, “I will not let you go unless you bless me.”","27":"So he said to him, “What is your name?” And he said, “Jacob.”","28":"Then he said, “Your name shall no longer be Jacob, but Israel; for you have contended with God and with men, and have prevailed.”","29":"And Jacob asked him and said, “Please tell me your name.” But he said, “Why is it that you ask my name?” And he blessed him there.","30":"So Jacob named the place Peniel, for he said, “I have seen God face to face, yet my life has been spared.”","31":"Now the sun rose upon him just as he crossed over Penuel, and he was limping on his hip.","32":"Therefore, to this day the sons of Israel do not eat the tendon of the hip which is on the socket of the hip, because he touched the socket of Jacob’s hip in the tendon of the hip."},"33":{"1":"Then Jacob raised his eyes and looked, and behold, Esau was coming, and four hundred men with him. So he divided the children among Leah and Rachel, and the two slave women.","2":"He put the slave women and their children in front, and Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph last.","3":"But he himself passed on ahead of them and bowed down to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.","4":"Then Esau ran to meet him and embraced him, and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept.","5":"He raised his eyes and saw the women and the children, and said, “Who are these with you?” So he said, “The children whom God has graciously given your servant.”","6":"Then the slave women came forward with their children, and they bowed down.","7":"And Leah likewise came forward with her children, and they bowed down; and afterward Joseph came forward with Rachel, and they bowed down.","8":"And he said, “What do you mean by all this company which I have met?” And he said, “To find favor in the sight of my lord.”","9":"But Esau said, “I have plenty, my brother; let what you have be your own.”","10":"Jacob said, “No, please, if now I have found favor in your sight, then accept my gift from my hand, for I see your face as one sees the face of God, and you have received me favorably.","11":"“Please accept my gift which has been brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me and because I have plenty.” So he urged him, and he accepted it.","12":"Then Esau said, “Let’s journey on and go, and I will go ahead of you.”","13":"But he said to him, “My lord knows that the children are frail and that the flocks and herds that are nursing are a matter of concern to me. And if they are driven hard just one day, all the flocks will die.","14":"“Please let my lord pass on ahead of his servant, and I will proceed at my leisure, at the pace of the cattle that are ahead of me and at the pace of the children, until I come to my lord at Seir.”","15":"Then Esau said, “Please let me leave with you some of the people who are with me.” But he said, “What need is there? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord.”","16":"So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.","17":"But Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built for himself a house and made booths for his livestock; therefore the place is named Succoth.","18":"Now Jacob came safely to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan-aram, and camped before the city.","19":"He bought the plot of land where he had pitched his tent from the hand of the sons of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for a hundred pieces of money.","20":"Then he erected there an altar and called it El-Elohe-Israel."},"34":{"1":"Now Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she had borne to Jacob, went out to visit the daughters of the land.","2":"When Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her, he took her and lay with her and raped her.","3":"But he was deeply attracted to Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the girl and spoke tenderly to her.","4":"So Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, “Get me this young woman as a wife.”","5":"Now Jacob heard that he had defiled his daughter Dinah; but his sons were with his livestock in the field, so Jacob said nothing until they came in.","6":"Then Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to speak with him.","7":"Now the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard about it; and the men were grieved, and they were very angry because he had done a disgraceful thing in Israel by sleeping with Jacob’s daughter, for such a thing ought not to be done.","8":"But Hamor spoke with them, saying, “The soul of my son Shechem longs for your daughter; please give her to him in marriage.","9":"“And intermarry with us; give your daughters to us and take our daughters for yourselves.","10":"“So you will live with us, and the land shall be open to you; live and trade in it and acquire property in it.”","11":"Shechem also said to her father and to her brothers, “Let me find favor in your sight, and I will give whatever you tell me.","12":"“Demand of me ever so much bridal payment and gift, and I will give whatever you tell me; but give me the girl in marriage.”","13":"But Jacob’s sons answered Shechem and his father Hamor with deceit, because he had defiled their sister Dinah.","14":"They said to them, “We cannot do this thing, that is, give our sister to a man who is uncircumcised, for that would be a disgrace to us.","15":"“Only on this condition will we consent to you: if you will become like us, in that every male of you will be circumcised,","16":"then we will give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters for ourselves, and we will live with you and become one people.","17":"“But if you do not listen to us to be circumcised, then we will take our daughter and go.”","18":"Now their words seemed reasonable to Hamor and Shechem, Hamor’s son.","19":"The young man did not delay to do this, because he was delighted with Jacob’s daughter. Now he was more respected than all the household of his father.","20":"So Hamor and his son Shechem came to the gate of their city and spoke to the people of their city, saying,","21":"“These men are friendly to us; therefore let them live in the land and trade in it, for behold, the land is large enough for them. We will take their daughters in marriage, and give our daughters to them.","22":"“Only on this condition will the men consent to us to live with us, to become one people: that every male among us be circumcised just as they are circumcised.","23":"“Will their livestock and their property and all their animals not be ours? Let’s just consent to them, and they will live with us.”","24":"All who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor and to his son Shechem, and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city.","25":"Now it came about on the third day, when they were in pain, that two of Jacob’s sons—Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers—each took his sword and came upon the city undetected, and killed every male.","26":"They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah from Shechem’s house, and left.","27":"Jacob’s sons came upon those killed and looted the city, because they had defiled their sister.","28":"They took their flocks, their herds, and their donkeys, and that which was in the city and that which was in the field;","29":"and they captured and looted all their wealth and all their little ones and their wives, even everything that was in the houses.","30":"Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have brought trouble on me by making me repulsive among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites; and since my men are few in number, they will band together against me and attack me, and I will be destroyed, I and my household!”","31":"But they said, “Should he treat our sister like a prostitute?”"},"35":{"1":"Then God said to Jacob, “Arise, go up to Bethel and live there, and make an altar there to God, who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau.”","2":"So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, “Remove the foreign gods which are among you, and purify yourselves and change your garments;","3":"and let’s arise and go up to Bethel, and I will make an altar there to God, who answered me on the day of my distress and has been with me wherever I have gone.”","4":"So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods which they had and the rings which were in their ears, and Jacob hid them under the oak which was near Shechem.","5":"As they journeyed, there was a great terror upon the cities which were around them, and they did not pursue the sons of Jacob.","6":"So Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him.","7":"Then he built an altar there, and called the place El-bethel, because there God had revealed Himself to him when he fled from his brother.","8":"Now Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died, and she was buried below Bethel under the oak; and it was named Allon-bacuth.","9":"Then God appeared to Jacob again when he came from Paddan-aram, and He blessed him.","10":"God said to him,\n“Your name is Jacob;\nYou shall no longer be called Jacob,\nBut Israel shall be your name.”\nSo He called him Israel.","11":"God also said to him,\n“I am God Almighty;\nBe fruitful and multiply;\nA nation and a multitude of nations shall come from you,\nAnd kings shall come from you.","12":"“And the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac,\nI will give to you,\nAnd I will give the land to your descendants after you.”","13":"Then God went up from him at the place where He had spoken with him.","14":"So Jacob set up a memorial stone in the place where He had spoken with him, a memorial of stone, and he poured out a drink offering on it; he also poured oil on it.","15":"And Jacob named the place where God had spoken with him, Bethel.","16":"Then they journeyed on from Bethel; but when there was still some distance to go to Ephrath, Rachel began to give birth and she suffered severe difficulties in her labor.","17":"And when she was suffering severe difficulties in her labor, the midwife said to her, “Do not fear, for you have another son!”","18":"And it came about, as her soul was departing (for she died), that she named him Ben-oni; but his father called him Benjamin.","19":"So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).","20":"And Jacob set up a memorial stone over her grave; that is the memorial stone of Rachel’s grave to this day.","21":"Then Israel journeyed on and pitched his tent beyond the tower of Eder.","22":"And it came about, while Israel was living in that land, that Reuben went and slept with his father’s concubine Bilhah, and Israel heard about it.\nNow there were twelve sons of Jacob—","23":"the sons of Leah were Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn, then Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun;","24":"the sons of Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin;","25":"and the sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s female slave, were Dan and Naphtali;","26":"and the sons of Zilpah, Leah’s female slave, were Gad and Asher.

Then she said, “What a breach you have made for yourself!” So he was named Perez.","30":"Afterward his brother came out who had the scarlet thread on his hand; and he was named Zerah."},"39":{"1":"Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an Egyptian officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the bodyguard, bought him from the Ishmaelites, who had taken him down there.","2":"And the LORD was with Joseph, so he became a successful man. And he was in the house of his master, the Egyptian.","3":"Now his master saw that the LORD was with him and that the LORD made all that he did prosper in his hand.","4":"So Joseph found favor in his sight and became his personal servant; and he made him overseer over his house, and put him in charge of all that he owned.","5":"It came about that from the time he made him overseer in his house and over all that he owned, the LORD blessed the Egyptian’s house on account of Joseph; so the LORD’S blessing was upon all that he owned, in the house and in the field.","6":"So he left Joseph in charge of everything that he owned; and with him there he did not concern himself with anything except the food which he ate.\nNow Joseph was handsome in form and appearance.","7":"And it came about after these events that his master’s wife had her eyes on Joseph, and she said, “Sleep with me.”","8":"But he refused and said to his master’s wife, “Look, with me here, my master does not concern himself with anything in the house, and he has put me in charge of all that he owns.","9":"“There is no one greater in this house than I, and he has withheld nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. How then could I do this great evil, and sin against God?”","10":"Though she spoke to Joseph day after day, he did not listen to her to lie beside her or be with her.","11":"Now it happened one day that he went into the house to do his work, and none of the people of the household was there inside.","12":"So she grabbed him by his garment, saying, “Sleep with me!” But he left his garment in her hand and fled, and went outside.","13":"When she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled outside,","14":"she called to the men of her household and said to them, “See, he has brought in a Hebrew to us to make fun of us; he came in to me to sleep with me, and I screamed.","15":"“When he heard that I raised my voice and screamed, he left his garment beside me and fled and went outside.”","16":"So she left his garment beside her until his master came home.","17":"Then she spoke to him with these words: “The Hebrew slave, whom you brought to us, came in to me to make fun of me;","18":"but when I raised my voice and screamed, he left his garment beside me and fled outside.”","19":"Now when his master heard the words of his wife which she spoke to him, saying, “This is what your slave did to me,” his anger burned.","20":"So Joseph’s master took him and put him into the prison, the place where the king’s prisoners were confined; and he was there in the prison.","21":"But the LORD was with Joseph and extended kindness to him, and gave him favor in the sight of the warden of the prison.","22":"And the warden of the prison put Joseph in charge of all the prisoners who were in the prison; so that whatever was done there, he was responsible for it.","23":"The warden of the prison did not supervise anything under Joseph’s authority, because the LORD was with him; and, the LORD made whatever he did prosper."},"40":{"1":"Then it came about after these things, that the cupbearer and the baker for the king of Egypt offended their lord, the king of Egypt.","2":"And Pharaoh was furious with his two officials, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker.","3":"So he put them in confinement in the house of the captain of the bodyguard, in the prison, the same place where Joseph was imprisoned.","4":"And the captain of the bodyguard put Joseph in charge of them, and he took care of them; and they were in confinement for some time.","5":"Then the cupbearer and the baker for the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison, both had a dream the same night, each man with his own dream and each dream with its own interpretation.","6":"When Joseph came to them in the morning and saw them, behold, they were dejected.","7":"So he asked Pharaoh’s officials who were with him in confinement in his master’s house, “Why are your faces so sad today?”","8":"And they said to him, “We have had a dream, and there is no one to interpret it.” Then Joseph said to them, “Do interpretations not belong to God? Tell it to me, please.”","9":"So the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph, saying to him, “In my dream, behold, there was a vine in front of me;","10":"and on the vine were three branches. And as it was budding, its blossoms came out, and its clusters produced ripe grapes.","11":"“Now Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand; so I took the grapes and squeezed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and I put the cup into Pharaoh’s hand.”","12":"Then Joseph said to him, “This is the interpretation of it: the three branches are three days;","13":"within three more days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your office; and you will put Pharaoh’s cup into his hand as in your former practice when you were his cupbearer.","14":"“Only keep me in mind when it goes well for you, and please do me a kindness by mentioning me to Pharaoh, and get me out of this prison.","15":"“For I was in fact kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews, and even here I have done nothing that they should have put me into the dungeon.”","16":"When the chief baker saw that he had interpreted favorably, he said to Joseph, “I also saw in my dream, and behold, there were three baskets of white bread on my head;","17":"and in the top basket there were some of all kinds of baked food for Pharaoh, and the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head.”","18":"Then Joseph answered and said, “This is its interpretation: the three baskets are three days;","19":"within three more days Pharaoh will lift up your head from you and will hang you on a wooden post, and the birds will eat your flesh off you.”","20":"So it came about on the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, that he held a feast for all his servants; and he lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker among his servants.","21":"He restored the chief cupbearer to his office, and he put the cup into Pharaoh’s hand;","22":"but he hanged the chief baker, just as Joseph had interpreted to them.","23":"Yet the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph, but forgot him."},"41":{"1":"Now it happened at the end of two full years that Pharaoh had a dream, and behold, he was standing by the Nile.","2":"And behold, from the Nile seven cows came up, fine-looking and fat; and they grazed in the marsh grass.","3":"Then behold, seven other cows came up after them from the Nile, ugly and thin, and they stood by the other cows on the bank of the Nile.","4":"Then the ugly and thin cows ate the seven fine-looking and fat cows. Then Pharaoh awoke.","5":"But he fell asleep and dreamed a second time; and behold, seven ears of grain came up on a single stalk, plump and good.","6":"Then behold, seven ears, thin and scorched by the east wind, sprouted up after them.","7":"And the thin ears swallowed the seven plump and full ears. Then Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream.","8":"Now in the morning his spirit was troubled, so he sent messengers and called for all the soothsayer priests of Egypt, and all its wise men. And Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was no one who could interpret them for Pharaoh.","9":"Then the chief cupbearer spoke to Pharaoh, saying, “I would make mention today of my own offenses.","10":"“Pharaoh was furious with his servants, and he put me in confinement in the house of the captain of the bodyguard, both me and the chief baker.","11":"“Then we had a dream one night, he and I; each of us dreamed according to the interpretation of his own dream.","12":"“Now a Hebrew youth was there with us, a servant of the captain of the bodyguard, and we told him the dreams, and he interpreted our dreams for us. For each man he interpreted according to his own dream.","13":"“And just as he interpreted for us, so it happened; Pharaoh restored me in my office, but he hanged the chief baker.”","14":"Then Pharaoh sent word and called for Joseph, and they hurriedly brought him out of the dungeon; and when he had shaved himself and changed his clothes, he came to Pharaoh.","15":"Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I have had a dream, but no one can interpret it; and I have heard it said about you, that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.”","16":"Joseph then answered Pharaoh, saying, “It has nothing to do with me; God will give Pharaoh an answer for his own good.”","17":"So Pharaoh said to Joseph, “In my dream, there I was, standing on the bank of the Nile;","18":"and behold, seven cows, fat and fine-looking came up out of the Nile, and they grazed in the marsh grass.","19":"“Then behold, seven other cows came up after them, poor and very ugly and thin, such as I had never seen for ugliness in all the land of Egypt;","20":"and the thin and ugly cows ate the first seven fat cows.","21":"“Yet when they had devoured them, it could not be detected that they had devoured them, for they were just as ugly as before. Then I awoke.","22":"“I saw also in my dream, and behold, seven ears of grain, full and good, came up on a single stalk;","23":"and behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and scorched by the east wind sprouted up after them;","24":"and the thin ears swallowed the seven good ears. Then I told it to the soothsayer priests, but there was no one who could explain it to me.”","25":"And Joseph said to Pharaoh, “Pharaoh’s dreams are one and the same; God has told to Pharaoh what He is about to do.","26":"“The seven good cows are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years; the dreams are one and the same.","27":"“The seven thin and ugly cows that came up after them are seven years, and the seven thin ears scorched by the east wind will be seven years of famine.","28":"“It is as I have spoken to Pharaoh: God has shown Pharaoh what He is about to do.","29":"“Behold, seven years of great abundance are coming in all the land of Egypt;","30":"and after them seven years of famine will come, and all the abundance will be forgotten in the land of Egypt, and the famine will ravage the land.","31":"“So the abundance will be unknown in the land because of that subsequent famine; for it will be very severe.","32":"“Now as for the repeating of the dream to Pharaoh twice, it means that the matter is confirmed by God, and God will quickly bring it about.","33":"“So now let Pharaoh look for a man discerning and wise, and appoint him over the land of Egypt.","34":"“Let Pharaoh take action to appoint overseers in charge of the land, and let him take a fifth of the produce of the land of Egypt as a tax in the seven years of abundance.","35":"“Then have them collect all the food of these good years that are coming, and store up the grain for food in the cities under Pharaoh’s authority, and have them guard it.","36":"“Let the food be used as a reserve for the land for the seven years of famine which will occur in the land of Egypt, so that the land will not perish during the famine.”","37":"Now the proposal seemed good to Pharaoh and to all his servants.","38":"Then Pharaoh said to his servants, “Can we find a man like this, in whom there is a divine spirit?”","39":"So Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Since God has informed you of all this, there is no one as discerning and wise as you are.","40":"“You shall be in charge of my house, and all my people shall be obedient to you; only regarding the throne will I be greater than you.”","41":"Pharaoh also said to Joseph, “See, I have placed you over all the land of Egypt.”","42":"Then Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand and put it on Joseph’s hand, and clothed him in garments of fine linen, and put the gold necklace around his neck.","43":"And he had him ride in his second chariot; and they proclaimed ahead of him, “Bow the knee!” And he placed him over all the land of Egypt.","44":"Moreover, Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Though I am Pharaoh, yet without your permission no one shall raise his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.”","45":"Then Pharaoh named Joseph Zaphenath-paneah; and he gave him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, to be his wife. And Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.","46":"Now Joseph was thirty years old when he stood in the presence of Pharaoh, king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh and went through all the land of Egypt.","47":"During the seven years of plenty the land produced abundantly.","48":"So he collected all the food of these seven years which occurred in the land of Egypt and put the food in the cities; he put in every city the food from its own surrounding fields.","49":"Joseph stored up grain in great abundance like the sand of the sea, until he stopped measuring it, for it was beyond measure.","50":"Now before the year of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, bore to him.","51":"Joseph named the firstborn Manasseh; “For,” he said, “God has made me forget all my trouble and all of my father’s household.”","52":"And he named the second Ephraim; “For,” he said, “God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.”","53":"When the seven years of plenty which had taken place in the land of Egypt came to an end,","54":"and the seven years of famine began to come, just as Joseph had said, then there was famine in all the lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.","55":"So when all the land of Egypt suffered famine, the people cried out to Pharaoh for bread; and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph; whatever he says to you, you shall do.”","56":"When the famine was spread over the entire face of the earth, then Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians; and the famine was severe in the land of Egypt.","57":"Then the people of all the earth came to Egypt to buy grain from Joseph, because the famine was severe in all the earth."},"42":{"1":"Now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, and Jacob said to his sons, “Why are you staring at one another?”","2":"Then he said, “Look, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt; go down there and buy some for us from that place, so that we may live and not die.”","3":"So ten of Joseph’s brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.","4":"But Jacob did not send Joseph’s brother Benjamin with his brothers, for he said, “I am afraid that harm may happen to him.”","5":"So the sons of Israel came to buy grain among those who were coming, because the famine was also in the land of Canaan.","6":"Now Joseph was the ruler over the land; he was the one who sold grain to all the people of the land. And Joseph’s brothers came and bowed down to him with their faces to the ground.","7":"When Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them, but he disguised himself to them and spoke to them harshly. He said to them, “Where have you come from?” And they said, “From the land of Canaan, to buy food.”","8":"But Joseph had recognized his brothers, although they did not recognize him.","9":"And Joseph remembered the dreams which he had about them, and he said to them, “You are spies; you have come to look at the undefended parts of our land.”","10":"And they said to him, “No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy food.","11":"“We are all sons of one man; we are honest men, your servants are not spies.”","12":"Yet he said to them, “No, but you have come to look at the undefended parts of our land!”","13":"But they said, “Your servants are twelve brothers in all, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and behold, the youngest is with our father today, and one is no longer alive.”","14":"Yet Joseph said to them, “It is as I said to you, you are spies;","15":"by this you will be tested: by the life of Pharaoh, you shall not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here!","16":"“Send one of you and have him get your brother, while you remain confined, so that your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you. But if not, by the life of Pharaoh, you are certainly spies!”","17":"So he put them all together in prison for three days.","18":"Now Joseph said to them on the third day, “Do this and live, for I fear God:","19":"if you are honest men, let one of your brothers be confined in your prison; but as for the rest of you, go, carry grain for the famine of your households,","20":"and bring your youngest brother to me, so that your words may be verified, and you will not die.” And they did so.","21":"Then they said to one another, “Truly we are guilty concerning our brother, because we saw the distress of his soul when he pleaded with us, yet we would not listen; for that reason this distress has happened to us.”","22":"Reuben answered them, saying, “Did I not tell you, ‘Do not sin against the boy’; and you would not listen? Now justice for his blood is required.”","23":"They did not know, however, that Joseph understood, for there was an interpreter between them.","24":"Then he turned away from them and wept. But when he returned to them and spoke to them, he took Simeon from them and bound him before their eyes.","25":"Then Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, but also to return every man’s money in his sack, and to give them provisions for the journey. And that is what was done for them.","26":"So they loaded their donkeys with their grain and departed from there.","27":"But when one of them opened his sack to give his donkey feed at the overnight campsite, he saw his money; and behold, it was in the opening of his sack!","28":"So he said to his brothers, “My money has been returned, and look, it is right in my sack!” Then their hearts sank, and they turned trembling to one another, saying, “What is this that God has done to us?”","29":"When they came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan, they told him everything that had happened to them, saying,","30":"“The man, the lord of the land, spoke harshly with us, and took us for spies of the country.","31":"“But we said to him, ‘We are honest men; we are not spies.","32":"‘We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is no longer alive, and the youngest is with our father today in the land of Canaan.’","33":"“But the man, the lord of the land, said to us, ‘By this I will know that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers with me and take grain for the famine of your households, and go.","34":"‘But bring your youngest brother to me so that I may know that you are not spies, but honest men. I will give your brother to you, and you may trade in the land.’”","35":"Now it came about, as they were emptying their sacks, that behold, every man’s bag of money was in his sack; and when they and their father saw their bags of money, they were afraid.","36":"And their father Jacob said to them, “You have deprived me of my sons: Joseph is gone, and Simeon is gone, and now you would take Benjamin; all these things are against me.”","37":"Then Reuben spoke to his father, saying, “You may put my two sons to death if I do not bring him back to you; put him in my care, and I will return him to you.”","38":"But Jacob said, “My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he alone is left. If harm should happen to him on the journey you are taking, then you will bring my gray hair down to Sheol in sorrow.”"},"43":{"1":"Now the famine was severe in the land.","2":"So it came about, when they had finished eating the grain which they had brought from Egypt, that their father said to them, “Go back, buy us a little food.”","3":"Judah spoke to him, however, saying, “The man sternly warned us, ‘You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.’","4":"“If you send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you food.","5":"“But if you do not send him, we will not go down; for the man said to us, ‘You will not see my face unless your brother is with you.’”","6":"Then Israel said, “Why did you treat me so badly, by telling the man whether you still had another brother?”","7":"But they said, “The man specifically asked about us and our relatives, saying, ‘Is your father still alive? Have you another brother?’ So we answered his questions. Could we possibly know that he would say, ‘Bring your brother down’?”","8":"So Judah said to his father Israel, “Send the boy with me and we will arise and go, so that we may live and not die, we as well as you and our little ones.","9":"“I myself will take responsibility for him! You may demand him back from me. If I do not bring him back to you and present him to you, then you can let me take the blame forever.","10":"“For if we had not delayed, surely by now we could have returned twice.”","11":"Then their father Israel said to them, “If it must be so, then do this: take some of the best products of the land in your bags, and carry down to the man as a gift, a little balsam and a little honey, labdanum resin and myrrh, pistachio nuts and almonds.","12":"“And take double the money in your hand, and take back in your hand the money that was returned in the opening of your sacks; perhaps it was a mistake.","13":"“Take your brother also, and arise, return to the man;","14":"and may God Almighty grant you compassion in the sight of the man, so that he will release to you your other brother and Benjamin. And as for me, if I am bereaved of my sons, I am bereaved!”","15":"So the men took this gift, and they took double the money in their hand, and Benjamin; then they set out and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.","16":"When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to his house steward, “Bring the men into the house, and slaughter an animal and make preparations; for the men are to dine with me at noon.”","17":"So the man did as Joseph said, and brought the men to Joseph’s house.","18":"Now the men were afraid, because they were brought to Joseph’s house; and they said, “It is because of the money that was returned in our sacks the first time that we are being brought in, so that he may attack us and overpower us, and take us as slaves with our donkeys.”","19":"So they approached Joseph’s house steward, and spoke to him at the entrance of the house,","20":"and said, “Oh, my lord, we indeed came down the first time to buy food,","21":"and it happened when we came to the campsite, that we opened our sacks, and behold, each man’s money was in the opening of his sack, our money in full. So we have brought it back in our hand.","22":"“We have also brought down other money in our hand to buy food; we do not know who put our money in our sacks.”","23":"But he said, “Peace be to you, do not be afraid. Your God and the God of your father has given you treasure in your sacks; your money was in my possession.” Then he brought Simeon out to them.","24":"Then the man brought the men into Joseph’s house and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their donkeys feed.","25":"So they prepared the gift for Joseph’s arrival at noon; for they had heard that they were to eat a meal there.","26":"When Joseph came home, they brought into the house to him the gift which was in their hand, and they bowed down to the ground before him.","27":"Then he asked them about their welfare, and said, “Is your old father well, of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?”","28":"And they said, “Your servant our father is well; he is still alive.” Then they bowed down again in homage.","29":"And as he raised his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother’s son, he said, “Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me?” Then he said, “May God be gracious to you, my son.”","30":"Joseph then hurried out, for he was deeply stirred over his brother, and he looked for a place to weep; so he entered his chamber and wept there.","31":"Then he washed his face and came out; and he controlled himself and said, “Serve the meal.”","32":"Then they served him by himself, and Joseph’s brothers by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves; because the Egyptians could not eat bread with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians.","33":"Now they were seated before him, from the firstborn according to his birthright to the youngest according to his youth, and the men looked at one another in astonishment.","34":"Then he took portions to them from his own table, but Benjamin’s portion was five times as much as any of theirs. So they drank freely with him."},"44":{"1":"Then he commanded his house steward, saying, “Fill the men’s sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man’s money in the opening of his sack.","2":"“And put my cup, the silver cup, in the opening of the sack of the youngest, and his money for the grain.” And he did as Joseph had told him.","3":"As soon as it was light, the men were sent away, they with their donkeys.","4":"They had just left the city, and were not far away, when Joseph said to his house steward, “Up, follow the men; and when you overtake them, say to them, ‘Why have you repaid evil for good?","5":"‘Is this not that from which my lord drinks, and which he indeed uses for divination? You have done wrong in doing this!’”","6":"So he overtook them and spoke these words to them.","7":"And they said to him, “Why does my lord say such words as these? Far be it from your servants to do such a thing!","8":"“Behold, the money which we found in the opening of our sacks we have brought back to you from the land of Canaan. How then could we steal silver or gold from your lord’s house?","9":"“With whomever of your servants it is found, he shall die, and we also shall be my lord’s slaves.”","10":"So he said, “Now let it indeed be according to your words; he with whom it is found shall be my slave, but the rest of you shall be considered innocent.”","11":"Then they hurried, each man lowered his sack to the ground, and each man opened his sack.","12":"And he searched, beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest; and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.","13":"Then they tore their clothes in grief, and when each man had loaded his donkey, they returned to the city.","14":"When Judah and his brothers came to Joseph’s house, he was still there, and they fell down to the ground before him.","15":"Joseph said to them, “What is this thing that you have done? Do you not know that a man who is like me can indeed practice divination?”","16":"So Judah said, “What can we say to my lord? What words can we speak? And how can we justify ourselves? God has found out the guilt of your servants; behold, we are my lord’s slaves, both we and the one in whose possession the cup has been found.”","17":"But he said, “Far be it from me to do this. The man in whose possession the cup has been found, he shall be my slave; but as for you, go up in peace to your father.”","18":"Then Judah approached him and said, “Oh my lord, may your servant please speak a word in my lord’s ears, and do not be angry with your servant; for you are equal to Pharaoh.","19":"“My lord asked his servants, saying, ‘Have you a father or a brother?’","20":"“And we said to my lord, ‘We have an old father and a little boy born in our father’s old age. Now his brother is dead, so he alone is left of his mother, and his father loves him.’","21":"“Then you said to your servants, ‘Bring him down to me so that I may set my eyes on him.’","22":"“But we said to my lord, ‘The boy cannot leave his father, for if he should leave his father, his father would die.’","23":"“You said to your servants, however, ‘Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you will not see my face again.’","24":"“So it came about when we went up to your servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.","25":"“And our father said, ‘Go back, buy us a little food.’","26":"“But we said, ‘We cannot go down. If our youngest brother is with us, then we will go down; for we cannot see the man’s face unless our youngest brother is with us.’","27":"“Then your servant my father said to us, ‘You know that my wife bore me two sons;","28":"and the one left me, and I said, “Surely he is torn to pieces,” and I have not seen him since.","29":"‘If you also take this one from me, and harm happens to him, you will bring my gray hair down to Sheol in sorrow.’","30":"“So now, when I come to your servant, my father, and the boy is not with us—since our father’s life is so attached to the boy’s life—","31":"when he sees that the boy is not with us, he will die. So your servants will bring the gray hair of your servant, our father, down to Sheol in sorrow.","32":"“For your servant accepted responsibility for the boy from my father, saying, ‘If I do not bring him back to you, then my father can let me take the blame forever.’","33":"“So now, please let your servant remain as a slave to my lord instead of the boy, and let the boy go up with his brothers.","34":"“For how shall I go up to my father if the boy is not with me?

And the sons of Israel groaned because of the bondage, and they cried out; and their cry for help because of their bondage ascended to God.","24":"So God heard their groaning; and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.","25":"And God saw the sons of Israel, and God took notice of them."},"3":{"1":"Now Moses was pasturing the flock of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian; and he led the flock to the west side of the wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of God.","2":"Then the angel of the LORD appeared to him in a blazing fire from the midst of a bush; and he looked, and behold, the bush was burning with fire, yet the bush was not being consumed.","3":"So Moses said, “I must turn aside and see this marvelous sight, why the bush is not burning up!”","4":"When the LORD saw that he turned aside to look, God called to him from the midst of the bush and said, “Moses, Moses!” And he said, “Here I am.”","5":"Then He said, “Do not come near here; remove your sandals from your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground.”","6":"And He said, “I am the God of your father—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” Then Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God.","7":"And the LORD said, “I have certainly seen the oppression of My people who are in Egypt, and have heard their outcry because of their taskmasters, for I am aware of their sufferings.","8":"“So I have come down to rescue them from the power of the Egyptians, and to bring them up from that land to a good and spacious land, to a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite.","9":"“And now, behold, the cry of the sons of Israel has come to Me; furthermore, I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians are oppressing them.","10":"“And now come, and I will send you to Pharaoh, so that you may bring My people, the sons of Israel, out of Egypt.”","11":"But Moses said to God, “Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring the sons of Israel out of Egypt?”","12":"And He said, “Assuredly I will be with you, and this shall be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall worship God at this mountain.”","13":"Then Moses said to God, “Behold, I am going to the sons of Israel, and I will say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you.’ Now they may say to me, ‘What is His name?’ What shall I say to them?”","14":"And God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM”; and He said, “This is what you shall say to the sons of Israel: ‘I AM has sent me to you.’”","15":"God furthermore said to Moses, “This is what you shall say to the sons of Israel: ‘The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you.’ This is My name forever, and this is the name for all generations to use to call upon Me.","16":"“Go and gather the elders of Israel together and say to them, ‘The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob has appeared to me, saying, “I am indeed concerned about you and what has been done to you in Egypt.","17":"“So I said, I will bring you up out of the oppression of Egypt to the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, to a land flowing with milk and honey.”’","18":"“Then they will pay attention to what you say; and you with the elders of Israel will come to the king of Egypt, and you will say to him, ‘The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us.

So you will plunder the Egyptians.”"},"4":{"1":"Then Moses said, “What if they will not believe me or listen to what I say? For they may say, ‘The LORD has not appeared to you.’”","2":"The LORD said to him, “What is that in your hand?” And he said, “A staff.”","3":"Then He said, “Throw it on the ground.” So he threw it on the ground, and it turned into a serpent; and Moses fled from it.","4":"But the LORD said to Moses, “Reach out with your hand and grasp it by its tail”—so he reached out with his hand and caught it, and it turned into a staff in his hand—","5":"“so that they may believe that the LORD, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you.”","6":"The LORD furthermore said to him, “Now put your hand inside the fold of your robe.” So he put his hand inside the fold, and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous like snow.","7":"Then He said, “Put your hand inside the fold of your robe again.” So he put his hand into the fold again, and when he took it out of the fold, behold, it was restored like the rest of his flesh.","8":"“So if they will not believe you nor pay attention to the evidence of the first sign, they may believe the evidence of the last sign.","9":"“But if they will not believe even these two signs nor pay attention to what you say, then you shall take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground; and the water which you take from the Nile will turn into blood on the dry ground.”","10":"Then Moses said to the LORD, “Please, Lord, I have never been eloquent, neither recently nor in time past, nor since You have spoken to Your servant; for I am slow of speech and slow of tongue.”","11":"But the LORD said to him, “Who has made the human mouth? Or who makes anyone unable to speak or deaf, or able to see or blind? Is it not I, the LORD?","12":"“Now then go, and I Myself will be with your mouth, and instruct you in what you are to say.”","13":"But he said, “Please, Lord, now send the message by whomever You will.”","14":"Then the anger of the LORD burned against Moses, and He said, “Is there not your brother Aaron the Levite? I know that he speaks fluently. And moreover, behold, he is coming out to meet you; when he sees you, he will be overjoyed.","15":"“So you are to speak to him and put the words in his mouth; and I Myself will be with your mouth and his mouth, and I will instruct you in what you are to do.","16":"“He shall speak for you to the people; and he will be as a mouth for you and you will be as God to him.","17":"“And you shall take in your hand this staff, with which you shall perform the signs.”","18":"Then Moses departed and returned to his father-in-law Jethro, and said to him, “Please, let me go, that I may return to my brothers who are in Egypt, and see if they are still alive.” And Jethro said to Moses, “Go in peace.”","19":"Now the LORD said to Moses in Midian, “Go back to Egypt, for all the men who were seeking your life are dead.”","20":"So Moses took his wife and his sons and mounted them on a donkey, and returned to the land of Egypt. Moses also took the staff of God in his hand.","21":"And the LORD said to Moses, “When you go back to Egypt, see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have put in your power; but I will harden his heart so that he will not let the people go.","22":"“Then you shall say to Pharaoh, ‘This is what the LORD says: “Israel is My son, My firstborn.","23":"“So I said to you, ‘Let My son go so that he may serve Me’; but you have refused to let him go.

At that time she said, “You are a groom of blood”—because of the circumcision.","27":"Now the LORD said to Aaron, “Go to meet Moses in the wilderness.” So he went and met him at the mountain of God and kissed him.","28":"Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD with which He had sent him, and all the signs that He had commanded him to do.","29":"Then Moses and Aaron went and assembled all the elders of the sons of Israel;","30":"and Aaron spoke all the words which the LORD had spoken to Moses.

Get back to your labors!”","5":"Again Pharaoh said, “Look, the people of the land are now many, and you would have them cease from their labors!”","6":"So the same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters over the people and their foremen, saying,","7":"“You are no longer to give the people straw to make bricks as previously; have them go and gather straw for themselves.","8":"“But you shall impose on them the quota of bricks which they were making before; you are not to reduce any of it. Because they are lazy, for that reason they cry out, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to our God.’","9":"“Let the labor be heavier on the men, and have them work at it so that they will pay no attention to false words.”","10":"So the taskmasters of the people and their foremen went out and spoke to the people, saying, “This is what Pharaoh says: ‘I am not going to give you any straw.","11":"‘You go, get straw for yourselves wherever you can find it; but none of your labor will be reduced.’”","12":"So the people scattered through all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.","13":"And the taskmasters pressed them, saying, “Complete your work quota, your daily amount, just as when you had straw.”","14":"Moreover, the foremen of the sons of Israel, whom Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten and asked, “Why have you not completed your required task of making bricks either yesterday or today, as before?”","15":"Then the foremen of the sons of Israel came and cried out to Pharaoh, saying, “Why do you deal this way with your servants?","16":"“There is no straw given to your servants, yet they keep saying to us, ‘Make bricks!’ And behold, your servants are being beaten; but it is the fault of your own people.”","17":"But he said, “You are lazy, very lazy; for that reason you say, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to the LORD.’","18":"“So go now and work; for you will be given no straw, but you must deliver the quota of bricks.”","19":"The foremen of the sons of Israel saw that they were in trouble, since they were told, “You must not reduce your daily amount of bricks.”","20":"When they left Pharaoh’s presence, they met Moses and Aaron as they were waiting for them.","21":"And they said to them, “May the LORD look upon you and judge you, because you have made us repulsive in Pharaoh’s sight and in the sight of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to kill us!”","22":"Then Moses returned to the LORD and said, “Lord, why have You brought harm to this people? Why did You ever send me?","23":"“Ever since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, he has done harm to this people, and You have not rescued Your people at all.”"},"6":{"1":"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh; for under compulsion he will let them go, and under compulsion he will drive them out of his land.”","2":"God spoke further to Moses and said to him, “I am the LORD;","3":"and I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as God Almighty, but by My name, LORD, I did not make Myself known to them.","4":"“I also established My covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land in which they lived as strangers.","5":"“Furthermore I have heard the groaning of the sons of Israel, because the Egyptians are holding them in bondage, and I have remembered My covenant.","6":"“Say, therefore, to the sons of Israel, ‘I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the labors of the Egyptians, and I will rescue you from their bondage.

These are the heads of the fathers’ households of the Levites according to their families.","26":"It was the same Aaron and Moses to whom the LORD said, “Bring out the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their multitudes.”","27":"They were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt about bringing out the sons of Israel from Egypt; it was the same Moses and Aaron.","28":"Now it came about on the day when the LORD spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt,","29":"that the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, “I am the LORD; say to Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say to you.”","30":"But Moses said before the LORD, “Behold, I am unskilled in speech; how then will Pharaoh listen to me?”"},"7":{"1":"Then the LORD said to Moses, “See, I have made you as God to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron shall be your prophet.","2":"“As for you, you shall speak all that I command you, and your brother Aaron shall speak to Pharaoh that he let the sons of Israel go out of his land.","3":"“But I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, so that I may multiply My signs and My wonders in the land of Egypt.","4":"“When Pharaoh does not listen to you, I will lay My hand on Egypt and bring out My armies, My people the sons of Israel, from the land of Egypt by great judgments.","5":"“Then the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I extend My hand over Egypt and bring out the sons of Israel from their midst.”","6":"So Moses and Aaron did this; as the LORD commanded them, so they did.","7":"And Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three, when they spoke to Pharaoh.","8":"Now the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,","9":"“When Pharaoh speaks to you, saying, ‘Work a miracle,’ then you shall say to Aaron, ‘Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh, so that it may turn into a serpent.’”","10":"So Moses and Aaron came to Pharaoh, and so they did, just as the LORD had commanded; and Aaron threw his staff down before Pharaoh and his servants, and it turned into a serpent.","11":"Then Pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers, and they too, the soothsayer priests of Egypt, did the same with their secret arts.","12":"For each one threw down his staff, and they turned into serpents. But Aaron’s staff swallowed their staffs.","13":"Yet Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them, just as the LORD had said.","14":"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Pharaoh’s heart is stubborn; he refuses to let the people go.","15":"“Go to Pharaoh in the morning just as he is going out to the water, and position yourself to meet him on the bank of the Nile; and you shall take in your hand the staff that was turned into a serpent.","16":"“And you shall say to him, ‘The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, sent me to you, saying, “Let My people go, so that they may serve Me in the wilderness.

And he lifted up the staff and struck the water that was in the Nile in the sight of Pharaoh and in the sight of his servants; and all the water that was in the Nile was turned into blood.","21":"Then the fish that were in the Nile died, and the Nile stank, so that the Egyptians could not drink water from the Nile. And the blood was through all the land of Egypt.","22":"But the soothsayer priests of Egypt did the same with their secret arts; and Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them, just as the LORD had said.","23":"Then Pharaoh turned and went into his house with no concern even for this.","24":"So all the Egyptians dug around the Nile for water to drink, because they could not drink from the water of the Nile.","25":"Seven days passed after the LORD had struck the Nile."},"8":{"1":"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and say to him, ‘This is what the LORD says: “Let My people go, so that they may serve Me.","2":"“But if you refuse to let them go, behold, I am going to strike your entire territory with frogs.","3":"“The Nile will swarm with frogs, which will come up and go into your house, and into your bedroom and on your bed, and into the houses of your servants, and on your people, and into your ovens and kneading bowls.","4":"“So the frogs will come up on you, your people, and on all your servants.”’”","5":"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, ‘Extend your hand with your staff over the rivers, over the streams, and over the pools, and make frogs come up on the land of Egypt.’”","6":"So Aaron extended his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt.","7":"However, the soothsayer priests did the same with their secret arts, making frogs come up on the land of Egypt.","8":"Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said, “Plead with the LORD to remove the frogs from me and from my people; and I will let the people go, so that they may sacrifice to the LORD.”","9":"And Moses said to Pharaoh, “The honor is yours to tell me: when shall I plead for you and your servants and your people, that the frogs be destroyed from you and your houses, that they be left only in the Nile?”","10":"Then he said, “Tomorrow.” So he said, “May it be according to your word, so that you may know that there is no one like the LORD our God.","11":"“The frogs will depart from you and your houses, and from your servants and your people; they will be left only in the Nile.”","12":"Then Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh, and Moses cried out to the LORD concerning the frogs which He had inflicted upon Pharaoh.","13":"The LORD did according to the word of Moses, and the frogs died out of the houses, the courtyards, and the fields.","14":"So they piled them in heaps, and the land stank.","15":"But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart and did not listen to them, just as the LORD had said.","16":"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, ‘Extend your staff and strike the dust of the earth, so that it may turn into gnats through all the land of Egypt.’”","17":"They did so; and Aaron extended his hand with his staff and struck the dust of the earth, and there were gnats on every person and animal.

Tomorrow this sign will occur.”’”","24":"Then the LORD did so. And thick swarms of flies entered the house of Pharaoh and the houses of his servants, and the land was laid waste because of the swarms of flies in all the land of Egypt.","25":"Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said, “Go, sacrifice to your God within the land.”","26":"But Moses said, “It is not permissible for us to do so, because we will sacrifice to the LORD our God that which is an abomination to the Egyptians.

Who specifically are the ones who are going?”","9":"Moses said, “We shall go with our young and our old; with our sons and our daughters, with our flocks and our herds we shall go, for we must hold a feast to the LORD.”","10":"Then he said to them, “So may the LORD be with you, when I let you and your little ones go! Watch out, for evil is on your mind!","11":"“Not so! Go now, but only the men among you, and serve the LORD, since that is what you desire.” So they were driven out from Pharaoh’s presence.","12":"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Reach out with your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, so that they may come up on the land of Egypt and eat every plant of the land, everything that the hail has left.”","13":"So Moses reached out with his staff over the land of Egypt, and the LORD directed an east wind on the land all that day and all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.","14":"The locusts came up over all the land of Egypt and settled in all the territory of Egypt; they were very numerous. There had never been so many locusts, nor would there be so many again.","15":"For they covered the surface of the whole land, so that the land was darkened; and they ate every plant of the land and all the fruit of the trees that the hail had left. Therefore nothing green was left on tree or plant of the field throughout the land of Egypt.","16":"Then Pharaoh hurriedly called for Moses and Aaron, and he said, “I have sinned against the LORD your God and against you.","17":"“So now, please forgive my sin only this once, and plead with the LORD your God, that He would only remove this death from me.”","18":"Then he left Pharaoh and pleaded with the LORD.","19":"So the LORD shifted the wind to a very strong west wind, which picked up the locusts and drove them into the Red Sea; not one locust was left in all the territory of Egypt.","20":"But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not let the sons of Israel go.","21":"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Reach out with your hand toward the sky, so that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even a darkness which may be felt.”","22":"So Moses reached out with his hand toward the sky, and there was thick darkness in all the land of Egypt for three days.","23":"They did not see one another, nor did anyone rise from his place for three days, but all the sons of Israel had light in their dwellings.","24":"Then Pharaoh called for Moses, and said, “Go, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be left behind. Even your little ones may go with you.”","25":"But Moses said, “You must also let us have sacrifices and burnt offerings, so that we may sacrifice them to the LORD our God.","26":"“Therefore, our livestock too shall go with us; not a hoof shall be left behind, for we shall take some of them to serve the LORD our God. And until we arrive there, we ourselves do not know with what we shall serve the LORD.”","27":"But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he was not willing to let them go.","28":"Then Pharaoh said to him, “Get away from me! Be careful, do not see my face again, for on the day you see my face, you shall die!”","29":"Moses said, “You have spoken correctly; I shall never see your face again!”"},"11":{"1":"Now the LORD said to Moses, “One more plague I will bring on Pharaoh and on Egypt; after that he will let you go from here. When he lets you go, he will assuredly drive you out from here completely.","2":"“Speak now so that the people hear, that each man is to ask of his neighbor, and each woman of her neighbor, articles of silver and articles of gold.”","3":"And the LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Furthermore, the man Moses himself was greatly esteemed in the land of Egypt, both in the sight of Pharaoh’s servants and in the sight of the people.","4":"Then Moses said, “This is what the LORD says: ‘About midnight I am going out into the midst of Egypt,","5":"and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of the Pharaoh who sits on his throne, to the firstborn of the slave girl who is behind the millstones; all the firstborn of the cattle as well.","6":"‘So there shall be a great cry in all the land of Egypt, such as there has not been before and such as shall never be again.","7":"‘But not even a dog will threaten any of the sons of Israel, nor anything from person to animal, so that you may learn how the LORD distinguishes between Egypt and Israel.’","8":"“And all these servants of yours will come down to me and bow themselves before me, saying, ‘Go out, you and all the people who follow you,’ and after that I will go out.” And he left Pharaoh in the heat of anger.","9":"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Pharaoh will not listen to you, so that My wonders will be multiplied in the land of Egypt.”","10":"So Moses and Aaron performed all these wonders before Pharaoh; yet the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not let the sons of Israel go out of his land."},"12":{"1":"Now the LORD said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt,","2":"“This month shall be the beginning of months for you; it is to be the first month of the year for you.","3":"“Speak to all the congregation of Israel, saying, ‘On the tenth of this month they are, each one, to take a lamb for themselves, according to the fathers’ households, a lamb for each household.","4":"‘Now if the household is too small for a lamb, then he and his neighbor nearest to his house are to take one according to the number of persons in them; in proportion to what each one should eat, you are to divide the lamb.","5":"‘Your lamb shall be an unblemished male a year old; you may take it from the sheep or from the goats.","6":"‘You shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month, then the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel is to slaughter it at twilight.","7":"‘Moreover, they shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and on the lintel of the houses in which they eat it.","8":"‘They shall eat the flesh that same night, roasted with fire, and they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.","9":"‘Do not eat any of it raw or boiled at all with water, but rather roasted with fire, both its head and its legs along with its entrails.","10":"‘And you shall not leave any of it over until morning, but whatever is left of it until morning, you shall completely burn with fire.","11":"‘Now you shall eat it in this way: with your garment belted around your waist, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it in a hurry—it is the LORD’S Passover.","12":"‘For I will go through the land of Egypt on that night, and fatally strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the human firstborn to animals; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments—I am the LORD.","13":"‘The blood shall be a sign for you on the houses where you live; and when I see the blood I will pass over you, and no plague will come upon you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.","14":"‘Now this day shall be a memorial to you, and you shall celebrate it as a feast to the LORD; throughout your generations you are to celebrate it as a permanent ordinance.","15":"‘For seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, but on the first day you shall remove dough with yeast from your houses; for whoever eats anything with yeast from the first day until the seventh day, that person shall be cut off from Israel.","16":"‘And on the first day you shall have a holy assembly, and another holy assembly on the seventh day; no work at all shall be done on them, except for what must be eaten by every person—that alone may be prepared by you.","17":"‘You shall also keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread, for on this very day I brought your multitudes out of the land of Egypt; therefore you shall keep this day throughout your generations as a permanent ordinance.","18":"‘In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, you shall eat unleavened bread, until the twenty-first day of the month at evening.","19":"‘For seven days there shall be no dough with yeast found in your houses; for whoever eats anything with yeast, that person shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he is a stranger or a native of the land.","20":"‘You shall not eat anything with yeast; in all your dwellings you shall eat unleavened bread.’”","21":"Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel and said to them, “Go and take for yourselves lambs according to your families, and slaughter the Passover lamb.","22":"“And you shall take a bunch of hyssop and dip it in the blood which is in the basin, and apply some of the blood that is in the basin to the lintel and the two doorposts; and none of you shall go outside the door of his house until morning.","23":"“For the LORD will pass through to strike the Egyptians; but when He sees the blood on the lintel and on the two doorposts, the LORD will pass over the door and will not allow the destroyer to come in to your houses to strike you.","24":"“And you shall keep this event as an ordinance for you and your children forever.","25":"“When you enter the land which the LORD will give you, as He has promised, you shall keep this rite.","26":"“And when your children say to you, ‘What does this rite mean to you?’","27":"then you shall say, ‘It is a Passover sacrifice to the LORD because He passed over the houses of the sons of Israel in Egypt when He struck the Egyptians, but spared our homes.’” And the people bowed low and worshiped.","28":"Then the sons of Israel went and did so; just as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.","29":"Now it came about at midnight that the LORD struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon, and all the firstborn of cattle.","30":"And Pharaoh got up in the night, he and all his servants and all the Egyptians, and there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was no home where there was not someone dead.","31":"Then he called for Moses and Aaron at night and said, “Rise up, get out from among my people, both you and the sons of Israel; and go, worship the LORD, as you have said.","32":"“Take both your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and go, and bless me also.”","33":"The Egyptians urged the people, to send them out of the land in a hurry, for they said, “We will all be dead.”","34":"So the people took their dough before it was leavened, with their kneading bowls bound up in the clothes on their shoulders.","35":"Now the sons of Israel had done according to the word of Moses, for they had requested from the Egyptians articles of silver and articles of gold, and clothing;","36":"and the LORD had given the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have their request. Therefore they plundered the Egyptians.","37":"Now the sons of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, aside from children.","38":"A mixed multitude also went up with them, along with flocks and herds, a very large number of livestock.","39":"And they baked the dough which they had brought out of Egypt into cakes of unleavened bread. For it had no yeast, since they were driven out of Egypt and could not delay, nor had they prepared any provisions for themselves.","40":"Now the time that the sons of Israel had lived in Egypt was 430 years.","41":"And at the end of 430 years, on this very day, all the multitudes of the LORD departed from the land of Egypt.","42":"It is a night to be observed for the LORD, for having brought them out of the land of Egypt; this night is for the LORD, to be observed by all the sons of Israel throughout their generations.","43":"And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, “This is the ordinance of the Passover: no foreigner is to eat it;","44":"but as for every slave that someone has purchased with money, after you have circumcised him, then he may eat it.","45":"“A stranger or a hired worker shall not eat it.","46":"“It is to be eaten in a single house; you are not to bring any of the meat outside of the house, nor are you to break any bone of it.","47":"“All the congregation of Israel are to celebrate this.","48":"“But if a stranger resides with you and celebrates the Passover to the LORD, all of his males are to be circumcised, and then he shall come near to celebrate it; and he shall be like a native of the land. But no uncircumcised male may eat it.","49":"“The same law shall apply to the native as to the stranger who resides among you.”","50":"Then all the sons of Israel did so; they did just as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron.","51":"And on that very day the LORD brought the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt according to their multitudes."},"13":{"1":"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,","2":"“Sanctify to Me every firstborn, the firstborn of every womb among the sons of Israel, among people and animals alike; it belongs to Me.”","3":"And Moses said to the people, “Remember this day in which you departed from Egypt, from the house of slavery; for by a powerful hand the LORD brought you out from this place. And nothing with yeast shall be eaten.","4":"“On this day in the month of Abib, you are about to go out from here.","5":"“And it shall be when the LORD brings you to the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, which He swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, that you shall perform this rite in this month.","6":"“For seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a feast to the LORD.","7":"“Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days; and nothing with yeast shall be seen among you, nor shall any dough with yeast be seen among you in all your borders.","8":"“And you shall tell your son on that day, saying, ‘It is because of what the LORD did for me when I came out of Egypt.’","9":"“And it shall serve as a sign to you on your hand, and as a reminder on your forehead, that the law of the LORD may be in your mouth; for with a powerful hand the LORD brought you out of Egypt.","10":"“Therefore, you shall keep this ordinance at its appointed time from year to year.","11":"“Now when the LORD brings you to the land of the Canaanite, as He swore to you and to your fathers, and gives it to you,","12":"you shall devote to the LORD every firstborn of a womb, and every firstborn offspring of an animal that you own; the males belong to the LORD.","13":"“But every firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb, but if you do not redeem it, then you shall break its neck; and every firstborn among your sons you shall redeem.","14":"“And it shall be when your son asks you in time to come, saying, ‘What is this?’ then you shall say to him, ‘With a powerful hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt, from the house of slavery.","15":"‘And it came about, when Pharaoh was stubborn about letting us go, that the LORD put to death every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from human firstborns to animal firstborns. Therefore, I sacrifice to the LORD the males, every firstborn of a womb, but every firstborn of my sons I redeem.’","16":"“So it shall serve as a sign on your hand and as phylacteries on your forehead, for with a powerful hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt.”","17":"Now when Pharaoh had let the people go, God did not lead them by the way of the land of the Philistines, even though it was near; for God said, “The people might change their minds when they see war, and return to Egypt.”","18":"Therefore God led the people around by way of the wilderness to the Red Sea; and the sons of Israel went up in battle formation from the land of Egypt.","19":"And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for he had made the sons of Israel solemnly swear, saying, “God will certainly take care of you, and you shall carry my bones from here with you.”","20":"Then they set out from Succoth and camped in Etham, on the edge of the wilderness.","21":"And the LORD was going before them in a pillar of cloud by day to lead them on the way, and in a pillar of fire by night to give them light, so that they might travel by day and by night.","22":"He did not take away the pillar of cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from the presence of the people."},"14":{"1":"Now the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,","2":"“Tell the sons of Israel to turn back and camp in front of Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea; you shall camp in front of Baal-zephon, opposite it, by the sea.","3":"“For Pharaoh will say of the sons of Israel, ‘They are wandering aimlessly in the land; the wilderness has shut them in.’","4":"“And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and he will chase after them; and I will be honored through Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD.” And they did so.","5":"When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, Pharaoh and his servants had a change of heart toward the people, and they said, “What is this that we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?”","6":"So he had horses harnessed to his chariot and took his people with him;","7":"and he took six hundred select chariots, and all the other chariots of Egypt with officers over all of them.","8":"So the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and he chased after the sons of Israel as the sons of Israel were going out boldly.","9":"Then the Egyptians chased after them with all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, his horsemen and his army, and they overtook them camping by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, in front of Baal-zephon.","10":"As Pharaoh approached, the sons of Israel looked, and behold, the Egyptians were coming after them, and they became very frightened; so the sons of Israel cried out to the LORD.","11":"Then they said to Moses, “Is it because there were no graves in Egypt that you have taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why have you dealt with us in this way, bringing us out of Egypt?","12":"“Is this not the word that we spoke to you in Egypt, saying, ‘Leave us alone so that we may serve the Egyptians’? For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness!”","13":"But Moses said to the people, “Do not fear! Stand by and see the salvation of the LORD, which He will perform for you today; for the Egyptians whom you have seen today, you will never see them again, ever.","14":"“The LORD will fight for you, while you keep silent.”","15":"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Why are you crying out to Me?

Therefore the one did not approach the other all night.","21":"Then Moses reached out with his hand over the sea; and the LORD swept the sea back by a strong east wind all night, and turned the sea into dry land, and the waters were divided.","22":"So the sons of Israel went through the midst of the sea on the dry land, and the waters were like a wall to them on their right and on their left.","23":"Then the Egyptians took up the pursuit, and all Pharaoh’s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen went in after them into the midst of the sea.","24":"But at the morning watch, the LORD looked down on the army of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and cloud, and brought the army of the Egyptians into confusion.","25":"He caused their chariot wheels to swerve, and He made them drive with difficulty; so the Egyptians each said, “Let me flee from Israel, for the LORD is fighting for them against the Egyptians.”","26":"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Reach out with your hand over the sea so that the waters may come back over the Egyptians, over their chariots and their horsemen.”","27":"So Moses reached out with his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its normal state at daybreak, while the Egyptians were fleeing right into it; then the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.","28":"The waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen, Pharaoh’s entire army that had gone into the sea after them; not even one of them remained.","29":"But the sons of Israel walked on dry land through the midst of the sea, and the waters were like a wall to them on their right and on their left.","30":"So the LORD saved Israel that day from the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore.","31":"When Israel saw the great power which the LORD had used against the Egyptians, the people feared the LORD, and they believed in the LORD and in His servant Moses."},"15":{"1":"Then Moses and the sons of Israel sang this song to the LORD, saying:\n“I will sing to the LORD, for He is highly exalted;\nThe horse and its rider He has hurled into the sea.","2":"“The LORD is my strength and song,\nAnd He has become my salvation;\nThis is my God, and I will praise Him;\nMy father’s God, and I will exalt Him.","3":"“The LORD is a warrior;\nThe LORD is His name.","4":"“Pharaoh’s chariots and his army He has thrown into the sea;\nAnd the choicest of his officers are drowned in the Red Sea.","5":"“The waters cover them;\nThey went down into the depths like a stone.","6":"“Your right hand, LORD, is majestic in power;\nYour right hand, LORD, destroys the enemy.","7":"“And in the greatness of Your excellence You overthrow those who rise up against You;\nYou send out Your burning anger, and it consumes them like chaff.","8":"“At the blast of Your nostrils the waters were piled up,\nThe flowing waters stood up like a heap;\nThe depths were congealed in the heart of the sea.","9":"“The enemy said, ‘I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoils;\nI shall be satisfied against them;\nI will draw my sword, my hand will destroy them.’","10":"“You blew with Your wind, the sea covered them;\nThey sank like lead in the mighty waters.","11":"“Who is like You among the gods, LORD?\nWho is like You, majestic in holiness,\nAwesome in praises, working wonders?","12":"“You reached out with Your right hand,\nThe earth swallowed them.","13":"“In Your faithfulness You have led the people whom You have redeemed;\nIn Your strength You have guided them to Your holy habitation.","14":"“The peoples have heard, they tremble;\nAnguish has gripped the inhabitants of Philistia.","15":"“Then the chiefs of Edom were terrified;\nThe leaders of Moab, trembling grips them;\nAll the inhabitants of Canaan have despaired.","16":"“Terror and dread fall upon them;\nBy the greatness of Your arm they are motionless as stone,\nUntil Your people pass over, LORD,\nUntil the people pass over whom You have purchased.","17":"“You will bring them and plant them in the mountain of Your inheritance,\nThe place, LORD, which You have made as Your dwelling,\nThe sanctuary, Lord, which Your hands have established.","18":"“The LORD shall reign forever and ever.”","19":"For the horses of Pharaoh with his chariots and his horsemen went into the sea, and the LORD brought back the waters of the sea on them, but the sons of Israel walked on dry land through the midst of the sea.","20":"Miriam the prophetess, Aaron’s sister, took the tambourine in her hand, and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dancing.","21":"And Miriam answered them,\n“Sing to the LORD, for He is highly exalted;\nThe horse and his rider He has hurled into the sea.”","22":"Then Moses led Israel from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur;

and what are we, that you grumble against us?”","8":"And Moses said, “This will happen when the LORD gives you meat to eat in the evening, and bread to the full in the morning; for the LORD hears your grumblings which you grumble against Him.

Your grumblings are not against us but against the LORD.”","9":"Then Moses said to Aaron, “Say to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, ‘Come forward before the LORD, for He has heard your grumblings.’”","10":"And it came about, as Aaron spoke to the entire congregation of the sons of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.","11":"And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,","12":"“I have heard the grumblings of the sons of Israel; speak to them, saying, ‘At twilight you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread; and you shall know that I am the LORD your God.’”","13":"So it came about at evening that the quails came up and covered the camp, and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp.","14":"When the layer of dew evaporated, behold, on the surface of the wilderness there was a fine flake-like thing, fine as the frost on the ground.","15":"When the sons of Israel saw it, they said to one another, “What is it?” For they did not know what it was. And Moses said to them, “It is the bread which the LORD has given you to eat.","16":"“This is what the LORD has commanded: ‘Everyone gather as much as he will eat; you shall take an omer apiece according to the number of people each of you has in his tent.’”","17":"The sons of Israel did so, and some gathered much and some little.","18":"When they measured it by the omer, the one who had gathered much did not have too much, and the one who had gathered little did not have too little; everyone gathered as much as he would eat.","19":"Moses said to them, “No one is to leave any of it until morning.”","20":"But they did not listen to Moses, and some left part of it until morning, and it bred worms and stank; and Moses was angry with them.","21":"They gathered it morning by morning, everyone as much as he would eat; but when the sun became hot, it would melt.","22":"Now on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one. When all the leaders of the congregation came and told Moses,","23":"then he said to them, “This is what the LORD meant: Tomorrow is a Sabbath observance, a holy Sabbath to the LORD. Bake what you will bake and boil what you will boil, and all that is left over put aside to be kept until morning.”","24":"So they put it aside until morning, as Moses had ordered, and it did not stink nor was there a maggot in it.","25":"Then Moses said, “Eat it today, for today is a Sabbath to the LORD; today you will not find it in the field.","26":"“Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will be none.”","27":"Yet it came about on the seventh day that some of the people went out to gather, but they found none.","28":"Then the LORD said to Moses, “How long do you refuse to keep My commandments and My instructions?","29":"“See, the LORD has given you the Sabbath; for that reason He gives you bread for two days on the sixth day.

Why do you test the LORD?”","3":"But the people were thirsty for water there; and they grumbled against Moses and said, “Why is it that you have brought us up from Egypt, to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?”","4":"So Moses cried out to the LORD, saying, “What am I to do with this people? A little more and they will stone me!”","5":"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Pass before the people and take with you some of the elders of Israel; and take in your hand your staff with which you struck the Nile, and go.","6":"“Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock at Horeb; and you shall strike the rock, and water will come out of it, so that the people may drink.” And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.","7":"Then he named the place Massah and Meribah because of the quarrel of the sons of Israel, and because they tested the LORD, saying, “Is the LORD among us, or not?”","8":"Then Amalek came and fought against Israel at Rephidim.","9":"So Moses said to Joshua, “Choose men for us and go out, fight against Amalek.

They have made for themselves a cast metal calf, and have worshiped it and have sacrificed to it and said, ‘This is your god, Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt!’”","9":"Then the LORD said to Moses, “I have seen this people, and behold, they are an obstinate people.","10":"“So now leave Me alone, that My anger may burn against them and that I may destroy them; and I will make of you a great nation.”","11":"Then Moses pleaded with the LORD his God, and said, “LORD, why does Your anger burn against Your people whom You have brought out from the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?","12":"“Why should the Egyptians talk, saying, ‘With evil motives He brought them out, to kill them on the mountains and to destroy them from the face of the earth’?

Is it not by Your going with us, so that we, I and Your people, may be distinguished from all the other people who are on the face of the earth?”","17":"The LORD said to Moses, “I will also do this thing of which you have spoken; for you have found favor in My sight and I have known you by name.”","18":"Then Moses said, “Please, show me Your glory!”","19":"And He said, “I Myself will make all My goodness pass before you, and will proclaim the name of the LORD before you; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show compassion to whom I will show compassion.”","20":"He further said, “You cannot see My face, for mankind shall not see Me and live!”","21":"Then the LORD said, “Behold, there is a place by Me, and you shall stand there on the rock;","22":"and it will come about, while My glory is passing by, that I will put you in the cleft of the rock and cover you with My hand until I have passed by.","23":"“Then I will take My hand away and you shall see My back, but My face shall not be seen.”"},"34":{"1":"Now the LORD said to Moses, “Cut out for yourself two stone tablets like the former ones, and I will write on the tablets the words that were on the former tablets which you smashed.","2":"“So be ready by morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and present yourself there to Me on the top of the mountain.","3":"“And no one is to come up with you, nor let anyone be seen anywhere on the mountain; even the flocks and the herds are not to graze in front of that mountain.”","4":"So he cut out two stone tablets like the former ones, and Moses got up early in the morning and went up to Mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and he took the two stone tablets in his hand.","5":"And the LORD descended in the cloud and stood there with him as he called upon the name of the LORD.","6":"Then the LORD passed by in front of him and proclaimed, “The LORD, the LORD God, compassionate and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding in faithfulness and truth;","7":"who keeps faithfulness for thousands, who forgives wrongdoing, violation of His Law, and sin; yet He will by no means leave the guilty unpunished, inflicting the punishment of fathers on the children and on the grandchildren to the third and fourth generations.”","8":"And Moses hurried to bow low toward the ground and worship.","9":"Then he said, “If in any way I have found favor in Your sight, Lord, please may the Lord go along in our midst, even though the people are so obstinate, and pardon our wrongdoing and our sin, and take us as Your own possession.”","10":"Then God said, “Behold, I am going to make a covenant.

You shall also assemble the whole congregation of the sons of Israel,","10":"and present the Levites before the LORD; and the sons of Israel shall lay their hands on the Levites.","11":"“Aaron then shall present the Levites before the LORD as a wave offering from the sons of Israel, so that they may qualify to perform the service of the LORD.","12":"“Now the Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the bulls; then you are to offer the one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering to the LORD, to make atonement for the Levites.","13":"“And you shall have the Levites stand before Aaron and his sons so as to present them as a wave offering to the LORD.","14":"“So you shall single out the Levites from among the sons of Israel, and the Levites shall be Mine.","15":"“Then after that the Levites may go in to serve the tent of meeting. But you shall cleanse them and present them as a wave offering;","16":"for they are exclusively given to Me from among the sons of Israel. I have taken them for Myself instead of the firstborn of every womb, the firstborn of all the sons of Israel.","17":"“For every firstborn among the sons of Israel is Mine, among the people and among the animals; on the day that I fatally struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, I sanctified them for Myself.","18":"“But I have taken the Levites instead of every firstborn among the sons of Israel.","19":"“And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the sons of Israel, to perform the service of the sons of Israel at the tent of meeting and to make atonement on behalf of the sons of Israel, so that there will be no affliction among the sons of Israel due to their approaching the sanctuary.”","20":"So this is what Moses, Aaron, and all the congregation of the sons of Israel did to the Levites; according to everything that the LORD had commanded Moses regarding the Levites, so the sons of Israel did to them.","21":"The Levites, too, purified themselves from sin and washed their clothes; and Aaron presented them as a wave offering before the LORD. Aaron also made atonement for them to cleanse them.","22":"Then after that the Levites went in to perform their service in the tent of meeting before Aaron and his sons; just as the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so they did to them.","23":"Now the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,","24":"“This is what applies to the Levites: from twenty-five years old and upward they shall enter to perform service in the work of the tent of meeting.","25":"“But at the age of fifty years they shall retire from service in the work and not work anymore.","26":"“They may, however, assist their brothers in the tent of meeting, to fulfill an obligation, but they themselves shall do no work.

That person will bear the responsibility for his sin.","14":"‘And if a stranger resides among you and celebrates the Passover to the LORD, according to the statute of the Passover and its ordinance, so he shall celebrate it; you shall have the same statute, both for the stranger and for the native of the land.’”","15":"Now on the day that the tabernacle was erected, the cloud covered the tabernacle, the tent of the testimony, and in the evening it was like the appearance of fire over the tabernacle until morning.","16":"That is how it was continuously; the cloud would cover it by day, and the appearance of fire by night.","17":"Whenever the cloud was lifted from over the tent, afterward the sons of Israel would set out; and in the place where the cloud settled down, there the sons of Israel would camp.","18":"At the command of the LORD the sons of Israel would set out, and at the command of the LORD they would camp; as long as the cloud settled over the tabernacle, they remained camped.","19":"Even when the cloud lingered over the tabernacle for many days, the sons of Israel would comply with the LORD’S ordinance and not set out.","20":"If sometimes the cloud remained a few days over the tabernacle, in accordance with the command of the LORD they remained camped. Then in accordance with the command of the LORD they set out.","21":"If sometimes the cloud remained from evening until morning, when the cloud was lifted in the morning they would set out; or if it remained in the daytime and at night, whenever the cloud was lifted, they would set out.","22":"Whether it was two days, a month, or a year that the cloud lingered over the tabernacle, staying above it, the sons of Israel remained camped and did not set out; but when it was lifted, they did set out.","23":"At the command of the LORD they camped, and at the command of the LORD they set out; they did what the LORD required, in accordance with the command of the LORD through Moses."},"10":{"1":"The LORD spoke further to Moses, saying,","2":"“Make yourself two trumpets of silver, you shall make them of hammered work; and you shall use them for summoning the congregation and breaking camp.","3":"“Now when both are blown, all the congregation shall meet you at the entrance of the tent of meeting.","4":"“But if only one is blown, then the leaders, the heads of the divisions of Israel, shall meet you.","5":"“And when you blow an alarm, the camps that are pitched on the east side shall set out.","6":"“Then when you sound an alarm the second time, the camps that are pitched on the south side shall set out; an alarm is to be sounded for them to break camp.","7":"“When convening the assembly, however, you shall blow the trumpets without sounding an alarm.","8":"“The sons of Aaron, moreover, the priests, shall blow the trumpets; and this shall be a permanent statute for you throughout your generations.","9":"“And when you go to war in your land against the enemy who attacks you, then you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets, so that you will be thought of by the LORD your God, and be saved from your enemies.","10":"“Also on the day of your joy and at your appointed feasts, and on the first days of your months, you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; and they shall be as a reminder of you before your God. I am the LORD your God.”","11":"Now in the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth of the month, the cloud was lifted from above the tabernacle of the testimony;","12":"and the sons of Israel set out on their journeys from the wilderness of Sinai. Then the cloud settled in the wilderness of Paran.","13":"So they moved on for the first time in accordance with the command of the LORD through Moses.","14":"The flag of the camp of the sons of Judah, by their armies, set out first, with Nahshon the son of Amminadab, over its army,","15":"and Nethanel the son of Zuar, over the tribal army of the sons of Issachar;","16":"and Eliab the son of Helon over the tribal army of the sons of Zebulun.","17":"Then the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, who were carrying the tabernacle, set out.","18":"Next the flag of the camp of Reuben, by their armies, set out with Elizur the son of Shedeur, over its army,","19":"and Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai over the tribal army of the sons of Simeon,","20":"and Eliasaph the son of Deuel was over the tribal army of the sons of Gad.","21":"Then the Kohathites set out, carrying the holy objects; and the tabernacle was set up before their arrival.","22":"Next the flag of the camp of the sons of Ephraim, by their armies, set out, with Elishama the son of Ammihud over its army,","23":"and Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur over the tribal army of the sons of Manasseh;","24":"and Abidan the son of Gideoni over the tribal army of the sons of Benjamin.","25":"Then the flag of the camp of the sons of Dan, by their armies, which formed the rear guard for all the camps, set out, with Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai over its army,","26":"and Pagiel the son of Ochran over the tribal army of the sons of Asher;","27":"and Ahira the son of Enan over the tribal army of the sons of Naphtali.","28":"This was the order of marching for the sons of Israel by their armies as they set out.","29":"Then Moses said to Hobab the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses’ father-in-law, “We are setting out to the place of which the LORD said, ‘I will give it to you.’ Come with us and we will do you good, for the LORD has promised good concerning Israel.”","30":"But he said to him, “I will not come, but rather will go to my own land and relatives.”","31":"Then he said, “Please do not leave us, since you know where we should camp in the wilderness, and you will be as eyes for us.","32":"“So it will be, if you go with us, that whatever good the LORD does for us, we will do for you.”","33":"So they moved on from the mountain of the LORD three days’ journey, with the ark of the covenant of the LORD going on in front of them for the three days, to seek out a resting place for them.","34":"And the cloud of the LORD was over them by day when they set out from the camp.","35":"Then it came about when the ark set out that Moses said,\n“Rise up, LORD!\nAnd may Your enemies be scattered,\nAnd those who hate You flee from Your presence.”","36":"And when it came to rest, he said,\n“Return, LORD,\nTo the myriad thousands of Israel.”"},"11":{"1":"Now the people became like those who complain of adversity in the ears of the LORD; and the LORD heard them and His anger was kindled, and the fire of the LORD burned among them and consumed some at the outskirts of the camp.","2":"The people then cried out to Moses; and Moses prayed to the LORD, and the fire died out.","3":"So that place was named Taberah, because the fire of the LORD burned among them.","4":"Now the rabble who were among them had greedy cravings; and the sons of Israel also wept again and said, “Who will give us meat to eat?","5":"“We remember the fish which we used to eat for free in Egypt, the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic;","6":"but now our appetite is gone. There is nothing at all to look at except this manna!”","7":"Now the manna was like coriander seed, and its appearance like that of bdellium.","8":"The people would roam about and gather it and grind it between two millstones, or pound it in the mortar, and boil it in the pot and make loaves with it; and its taste was like the taste of cake baked with oil.","9":"When the dew came down on the camp at night, the manna would come down with it.","10":"Now Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, each one at the entrance of his tent; and the anger of the LORD became very hot, and Moses was displeased.","11":"So Moses said to the LORD, “Why have You been so hard on Your servant? And why have I not found favor in Your sight, that You have put the burden of all this people on me?","12":"“Was it I who conceived all this people? Or did I give birth to them, that You should say to me, ‘Carry them in your arms, as a nurse carries a nursing infant, to the land which You swore to their fathers’?","13":"“Where am I to get meat to give to all this people? For they weep before me, saying, ‘Give us meat so that we may eat!’","14":"“I am not able to carry all this people by myself, because it is too burdensome for me.","15":"“So if You are going to deal with me this way, please kill me now, if I have found favor in Your sight, and do not let me see my misery.”","16":"The LORD therefore said to Moses, “Gather for Me seventy men from the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people and their officers, and bring them to the tent of meeting, and have them take their stand there with you.","17":"“Then I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take away some of the Spirit who is upon you, and put Him upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, so that you will not bear it by yourself.","18":"“And you shall say to the people, ‘Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, and you shall eat meat; for you have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying, “Oh that someone would give us meat to eat! For we were well-off in Egypt.” Therefore the LORD will give you meat and you shall eat.","19":"‘You shall eat, not one day, nor two days, nor five days, nor ten days, nor twenty days,","20":"but for a whole month, until it comes out of your nose and makes you nauseated; because you have rejected the LORD who is among you and have wept before Him, saying, “Why did we ever leave Egypt?”’”","21":"But Moses said, “The people, among whom I am included, are six hundred thousand on foot! Yet You have said, ‘I will give them meat, so that they may eat for a whole month.’","22":"“Are flocks and herds to be slaughtered for them, so that it will be sufficient for them? Or are all the fish of the sea to be caught for them, so that it will be sufficient for them?”","23":"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Is the LORD’S power too little? Now you shall see whether My word will come true for you or not.”","24":"So Moses went out and told the people the words of the LORD. He also gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and positioned them around the tent.","25":"Then the LORD came down in the cloud and spoke to him; and He took away some of the Spirit who was upon him and placed Him upon the seventy elders. And when the Spirit rested upon them, they prophesied. Yet they did not do it again.","26":"But two men had remained in the camp; the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other, Medad. And the Spirit rested upon them (and they were among those who had been registered, but had not gone out to the tent), and they prophesied in the camp.","27":"So a young man ran and informed Moses, and said, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.”","28":"Then Joshua the son of Nun, the personal servant of Moses from his youth, responded and said, “My lord Moses, restrain them!”","29":"But Moses said to him, “Are you jealous for my sake? If only all the LORD’S people were prophets, that the LORD would put His Spirit upon them!”","30":"Then Moses returned to the camp, both he and the elders of Israel.","31":"Now a wind burst forth from the LORD and it brought quail from the sea, and dropped them beside the camp, about a day’s journey on this side and a day’s journey on the other side all around the camp, and about two cubits deep on the surface of the ground.","32":"And the people spent all that day, all night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quail (the one who gathered least gathered ten homers) and spread them out for themselves all around the camp.","33":"While the meat was still between their teeth, before it was chewed, the anger of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD struck the people with a very severe plague.","34":"So that place was named Kibroth-hattaavah, because there they buried the people who had been greedy.","35":"From Kibroth-hattaavah the people set out for Hazeroth, and they remained at Hazeroth."},"12":{"1":"Then Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married (for he had married a Cushite woman);","2":"and they said, “Is it a fact that the LORD has spoken only through Moses? Has He not spoken through us as well?” And the LORD heard this.","3":"(Now the man Moses was very humble, more than any person who was on the face of the earth.)","4":"And the LORD suddenly said to Moses and to Aaron and Miriam, “You three go out to the tent of meeting.” So the three of them went out.","5":"Then the LORD came down in a pillar of cloud and stood at the entrance of the tent; and He called Aaron and Miriam. When they had both come forward,","6":"He said,\n“Now hear My words:\nIf there is a prophet among you,\nI, the LORD, will make Myself known to him in a vision.\nI will speak with him in a dream.","7":"“It is not this way for My servant Moses;\nHe is faithful in all My household;","8":"With him I speak mouth to mouth,\nThat is, openly, and not using mysterious language,\nAnd he beholds the form of the LORD.\nSo why were you not afraid\nTo speak against My servant, against Moses?”","9":"And the anger of the LORD burned against them and He departed.","10":"But when the cloud had withdrawn from above the tent, behold, Miriam was leprous, as white as snow. As Aaron turned toward Miriam, behold, she was leprous.","11":"Then Aaron said to Moses, “Oh, my lord, I beg you, do not hold us responsible for this sin by which we have turned out to be foolish, and by which we have sinned.","12":"“Oh, do not let her be like a dead person, whose flesh is half eaten away when he comes out of his mother’s womb!”","13":"So Moses cried out to the LORD, saying, “God, heal her, please!”","14":"But the LORD said to Moses, “If her father had only spit in her face, would she not be put to shame for seven days? Have her shut outside the camp for seven days, and afterward she may be received again.”","15":"So Miriam was shut outside the camp for seven days, and the people did not move on until Miriam was received again.","16":"Afterward, however, the people moved on from Hazeroth and camped in the wilderness of Paran."},"13":{"1":"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,","2":"“Send out men for yourself to spy out the land of Canaan, which I am going to give the sons of Israel; you shall send a man from each of their fathers’ tribes, every one a leader among them.”","3":"So Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran at the command of the LORD, all of them men who were heads of the sons of Israel.","4":"These then were their names: from the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur;","5":"from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori;","6":"from the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh;","7":"from the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph;","8":"from the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun;","9":"from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu;","10":"from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi;","11":"from the tribe of Joseph, from the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi;","12":"from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli;","13":"from the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael;","14":"from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi;","15":"and from the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.","16":"These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land; but Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun, Joshua.","17":"When Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, he said to them, “Go up there into the Negev; then go up into the hill country.","18":"“See what the land is like, and whether the people who live in it are strong or weak, whether they are few or many.","19":"“And how is the land in which they live, is it good or bad? And how are the cities in which they live, are the people in open camps or in fortifications?","20":"“And how is the land, is it productive or unproductive? Are there trees in it or not? And show yourselves courageous and get some of the fruit of the land.” Now the time was the season of the first ripe grapes.","21":"So they went up and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin as far as Rehob, at Lebo-hamath.","22":"When they had gone up into the Negev, they came to Hebron where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the descendants of Anak were. (Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)","23":"Then they came to the Valley of Eshcol, and from there they cut off a branch with a single cluster of grapes; and they carried it on a pole between two men, with some of the pomegranates and the figs.","24":"That place was called the Valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the sons of Israel cut off from there.","25":"When they returned from spying out the land, at the end of forty days,","26":"they went on and came to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, in the wilderness of Paran at Kadesh; and they brought back word to them and to all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.","27":"So they reported to him and said, “We came into the land where you sent us, and it certainly does flow with milk and honey, and this is its fruit.","28":"“Nevertheless, the people who live in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified and very large.

Would it not be better for us to return to Egypt?”","4":"So they said to one another, “Let’s appoint a leader and return to Egypt!”","5":"Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces in the presence of all the assembly of the congregation of the sons of Israel.","6":"And Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, of those who had spied out the land, tore their clothes;","7":"and they spoke to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, saying, “The land which we passed through to spy out is an exceedingly good land.","8":"“If the LORD is pleased with us, then He will bring us into this land and give it to us—a land which flows with milk and honey.","9":"“Only do not rebel against the LORD; and do not fear the people of the land, for they will be our prey.

So Aaron will be gathered to his people and will die there.”","27":"So Moses did just as the LORD had commanded, and they went up to Mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.","28":"And after Moses stripped Aaron of his garments and put them on his son Eleazar, Aaron died there on the mountain top. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.","29":"When all the congregation saw that Aaron had died, the whole house of Israel wept for Aaron for thirty days."},"21":{"1":"When the Canaanite, the king of Arad, who lived in the Negev, heard that Israel was coming by the way of Atharim, he fought against Israel and took some of them captive.","2":"So Israel made a vow to the LORD and said, “If You will indeed hand over this people to me, then I will utterly destroy their cities.”","3":"The LORD heard the voice of Israel and turned over the Canaanites; then they utterly destroyed them and their cities. And the place was named Hormah.","4":"Then they set out from Mount Hor by the way of the Red Sea, to go around the land of Edom; and the people became impatient because of the journey.","5":"So the people spoke against God and Moses: “Why have you brought us up from Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no food and no water, and we are disgusted with this miserable food.”","6":"Then the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people, so that many people of Israel died.","7":"So the people came to Moses and said, “We have sinned, because we have spoken against the LORD and against you; intercede with the LORD, that He will remove the serpents from us.” And Moses interceded for the people.","8":"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Make a fiery serpent, and put it on a flag pole; and it shall come about, that everyone who is bitten, and looks at it, will live.”","9":"So Moses made a bronze serpent and put it on the flag pole; and it came about, that if a serpent bit someone, and he looked at the bronze serpent, he lived.","10":"Now the sons of Israel moved out and camped in Oboth.","11":"Then they journeyed from Oboth and camped at Iye-abarim, in the wilderness which is opposite Moab, to the east.","12":"From there they set out and camped in Wadi Zered.","13":"From there they journeyed and camped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness that comes out of the border of the Amorites; for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.","14":"For that reason it is said in the Book of the Wars of the LORD,\n“Waheb in Suphah,\nAnd the wadis of the Arnon,","15":"And the slope of the wadis\nThat extends to the site of Ar,\nAnd leans to the border of Moab.”","16":"From there they continued to Beer, that is the well where the LORD said to Moses, “Assemble the people, that I may give them water.”","17":"Then Israel sang this song:\n“Spring up, O well! Sing to it!","18":"“The well, which the leaders dug,\nWhich the nobles of the people hollowed out,\nWith the scepter and with their staffs.”\nAnd from the wilderness they continued to Mattanah,","19":"and from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth,","20":"and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the land of Moab, at the top of Pisgah, which overlooks the desert.","21":"Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon, king of the Amorites, saying,","22":"“Let me pass through your land. We will not turn off into field or vineyard; we will not drink water from wells. We will go by the king’s road until we have passed through your border.”","23":"But Sihon would not permit Israel to pass through his border. Instead, Sihon gathered all his people and went out against Israel in the wilderness, and came to Jahaz and fought against Israel.","24":"Then Israel struck him with the edge of the sword, and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, as far as the sons of Ammon; for the border of the sons of Ammon was Jazer.","25":"Israel took all these cities, and Israel lived in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon and in all her villages.","26":"For Heshbon was the city of Sihon, king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and had taken all his land out of his hand, as far as the Arnon.","27":"For that reason those who use proverbs say,\n“Come to Heshbon! Let it be built!\nSo let the city of Sihon be established.","28":"“For a fire spread from Heshbon,\nA flame from the town of Sihon;\nIt devoured Ar of Moab,\nThe dominant heights of the Arnon.","29":"“Woe to you, Moab!\nYou are destroyed, people of Chemosh!\nHe has given his sons as fugitives,\nAnd his daughters into captivity,\nTo an Amorite king, Sihon.","30":"“But we have shot them down with arrows,\nHeshbon is destroyed as far as Dibon,\nThen we have laid waste as far as Nophah,\nWhich reaches to Medeba.”","31":"So Israel lived in the land of the Amorites.","32":"Now Moses sent men to spy out Jazer, and they captured its villages and dispossessed the Amorites who were there.","33":"Then they turned and went up by the way of Bashan, and Og the king of Bashan went out against them with all his people, for battle at Edrei.","34":"But the LORD said to Moses, “Do not fear him, for I have handed him over to you, and all his people and his land; and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon, king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon.”","35":"So they killed him and his sons and all his people, until there was no survivor left; and they took possession of his land."},"22":{"1":"Then the sons of Israel journeyed on, and camped in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan opposite Jericho.","2":"Now Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.","3":"So Moab was in great fear because of the people, for they were numerous; and Moab was in dread of the sons of Israel.","4":"Moab said to the elders of Midian, “Now this horde will eat up all that is around us, as the ox eats up the grass of the field!” And Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time.","5":"So he sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor, at Pethor, which is near the Euphrates River, in the land of the sons of his people, to call for him, saying, “Behold, a people came out of Egypt; behold, they have covered the surface of the land, and they are living opposite me.","6":"“Now, therefore, please come, curse this people for me since they are too mighty for me; perhaps I will be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land. For I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed.”","7":"So the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian left with the fees for divination in their hands; and they came to Balaam and repeated Balak’s words to him.","8":"And he said to them, “Spend the night here, and I will bring word back to you just as the LORD may speak to me.” And the leaders of Moab stayed with Balaam.","9":"Then God came to Balaam and said, “Who are these men with you?”","10":"Balaam said to God, “Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, sent word to me:","11":"‘Behold, there is a people who came out of Egypt, and they cover the surface of the land; now come, curse them for me; perhaps I will be able to fight against them and drive them out.’”","12":"But God said to Balaam, “Do not go with them; you shall not curse the people, for they are blessed.”","13":"So Balaam got up in the morning and said to Balak’s representatives, “Go back to your land, for the LORD has refused to let me go with you.”","14":"And the representatives from Moab got up and went to Balak, and said, “Balaam refused to come with us.”","15":"Then Balak sent representatives once again, more numerous and more distinguished than the previous.","16":"They came to Balaam and said to him, “This is what Balak the son of Zippor says: ‘I beg you, let nothing keep you from coming to me;","17":"for I will indeed honor you richly, and I will do whatever you tell me. Please come then, curse this people for me.’”","18":"But Balaam replied to the servants of Balak, “Even if Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not do anything, either small or great, contrary to the command of the LORD my God.","19":"“Now please, you also stay here tonight, and I will find out what else the LORD will say to me.”","20":"And God came to Balaam at night and said to him, “If the men have come to call you, rise and go with them; but you shall do only the thing that I tell you.”","21":"So Balaam arose in the morning, saddled his donkey, and went with the leaders of Moab.","22":"But God was angry that he was going, and the angel of the LORD took his stand in the road as an adversary against him. Now he was riding on his donkey, and his two servants were with him.","23":"When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD standing in the road with his sword drawn in his hand, the donkey turned off from the road and went into the field; and Balaam struck the donkey to guide her back onto the road.","24":"Then the angel of the LORD stood in a narrow path of the vineyards, with a stone wall on this side and on that side.","25":"When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, she pressed herself against the wall and pressed Balaam’s foot against the wall, so he struck her again.","26":"Then the angel of the LORD went farther, and stood in a narrow place where there was no way to turn to the right or to the left.","27":"When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, she lay down under Balaam; so Balaam was angry and struck the donkey with his staff.","28":"Then the LORD opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, “What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?”","29":"And Balaam said to the donkey, “It is because you have made a mockery of me! If only there had been a sword in my hand! For I would have killed you by now!”","30":"But the donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not your donkey on which you have ridden all your life to this day? Have I ever been in the habit of doing such a thing to you?” And he said, “No.”","31":"Then the LORD opened Balaam’s eyes, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way with his sword drawn in his hand; and he bowed all the way to the ground.","32":"Then the angel of the LORD said to him, “Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come out as an adversary, because your way was reckless and contrary to me.","33":"“But the donkey saw me and turned away from me these three times. If she had not turned away from me, I certainly would have killed you just now, and let her live.”","34":"So Balaam said to the angel of the LORD, “I have sinned, for I did not know that you were standing in the way against me. Now then, if it is displeasing to you, I will turn back.”","35":"But the angel of the LORD said to Balaam, “Go with the men, but you shall speak only the word that I tell you.” So Balaam went along with the representatives of Balak.","36":"When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the city of Moab, which is on the Arnon border, at the extreme end of the border.","37":"Then Balak said to Balaam, “Did I not urgently send word to you to call for you? Why did you not come to me? Am I really unable to honor you?”","38":"So Balaam said to Balak, “Behold, I have come to you now! Am I really able to speak anything? The word that God puts in my mouth, that only shall I speak.”","39":"And Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath-huzoth.","40":"Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent some to Balaam and the leaders who were with him.","41":"Then it came about in the morning that Balak took Balaam and brought him up to the high places of Baal, and he saw from there a portion of the people."},"23":{"1":"Then Balaam said to Balak, “Build seven altars for me here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me here.”","2":"Balak did just as Balaam had spoken, and Balak and Balaam offered up a bull and a ram on each altar.","3":"Then Balaam said to Balak, “Stand beside your burnt offering, and I will go; perhaps the LORD will come to meet me, and whatever He shows me I will tell you.” So he went to a bare hill.","4":"Now God met with Balaam, and he said to Him, “I have set up the seven altars, and I have offered up a bull and a ram on each altar.”","5":"Then the LORD put a word in Balaam’s mouth and said, “Return to Balak, and this is what you shall speak.”","6":"So he returned to him, and behold, he was standing beside his burnt offering, he and all the leaders of Moab.","7":"And he took up his discourse and said,\n“From Aram Balak has brought me,\nMoab’s king from the mountains of the East, saying,\n‘Come, declare Jacob cursed for me,\nAnd come, curse Israel!’","8":"“How am I to put a curse on him upon whom God has not put a curse?\nAnd how am I to curse him whom the LORD has not cursed?","9":"“For I see him from the top of the rocks,\nAnd I look at him from the hills;\nBehold, a people that lives in isolation,\nAnd does not consider itself to be among the nations.","10":"“Who has counted the dust of Jacob,\nOr the number of the fourth part of Israel?\nMay I die the death of the upright,\nAnd may my end be like his!”","11":"Then Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I took you to put a curse on my enemies, but behold, you have actually blessed them!”","12":"He replied, “Must I not be careful to speak what the LORD puts in my mouth?”","13":"Then Balak said to him, “Please come with me to another place from where you may see them, although you will only see the extreme end of them and will not see all of them; and put a curse on them for me from there.”","14":"So he took him to the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and he built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.","15":"Then he said to Balak, “Stand here beside your burnt offering while I myself meet the LORD over there.”","16":"Then the LORD met Balaam and put a word in his mouth, and said, “Return to Balak, and this is what you shall speak.”","17":"So he came to him, and behold, he was standing beside his burnt offering, and the leaders of Moab with him. And Balak said to him, “What has the LORD spoken?”","18":"Then he took up his discourse and said,\n“Arise, Balak, and hear;\nListen to me, son of Zippor!","19":"“God is not a man, that He would lie,\nNor a son of man, that He would change His mind;\nHas He said, and will He not do it?\nOr has He spoken, and will He not make it good?","20":"“Behold, I have received a command to bless;\nWhen He has blessed, I cannot revoke it.","21":"“He has not looked at misfortune in Jacob;\nNor has He seen trouble in Israel;\nThe LORD his God is with him,\nAnd the joyful shout of a king is among them.","22":"“God brings them out of Egypt,\nHe is for them like the horns of the wild ox.","23":"“For there is no magic curse against Jacob,\nNor is there any divination against Israel;\nAt the proper time it shall be said to Jacob\nAnd to Israel, what God has done!","24":"“Behold, a people rises like a lioness,\nAnd like a lion it raises itself;\nIt will not lie down until it devours the prey,\nAnd drinks the blood of those slain.”","25":"Then Balak said to Balaam, “Do not curse them at all nor bless them at all!”","26":"But Balaam replied to Balak, “Did I not tell you, ‘Whatever the LORD speaks, I must do’?”","27":"Then Balak said to Balaam, “Please come, I will take you to another place; perhaps it will be agreeable with God that you curse them for me from there.”","28":"So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, which overlooks the desert.","29":"And Balaam said to Balak, “Build seven altars for me here and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me here.”","30":"Balak did just as Balaam had said, and offered up a bull and a ram on each altar."},"24":{"1":"When Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he did not go as at other times to seek omens, rather he turned his attention toward the wilderness.","2":"And Balaam raised his eyes and saw Israel camping tribe by tribe; and the Spirit of God came upon him.","3":"Then he took up his discourse and said,\n“The declaration of Balaam the son of Beor,\nAnd the declaration of the man whose eye is opened;","4":"The declaration of him who hears the words of God,\nWho sees the vision of the Almighty,\nFalling down, yet having his eyes uncovered,","5":"How pleasant are your tents, Jacob,\nYour dwelling places, Israel!","6":"“Like valleys that stretch out,\nLike gardens beside a river,\nLike aloes planted by the LORD,\nLike cedars beside the waters.","7":"“Water will flow from his buckets,\nAnd his seed will be by many waters,\nAnd his king shall be higher than Agag,\nAnd his kingdom shall be exalted.","8":"“God brings him out of Egypt,\nHe is for him like the horns of the wild ox.\nHe will devour the nations who are his adversaries,\nAnd will crush their bones,\nAnd smash them with his arrows.","9":"“He crouches, he lies down like a lion,\nAnd like a lioness, who dares to rouse him?\nBlessed is everyone who blesses you,\nAnd cursed is everyone who curses you.”","10":"Then Balak’s anger burned against Balaam, and he struck his hands together; and Balak said to Balaam, “I called you to curse my enemies, but behold, you have persisted in blessing them these three times!","11":"“So flee to your place now.

Then afterward you may go on your way.”","17":"And the men said to her, “We shall be exempt from this oath to you which you have made us swear,","18":"unless, when we come into the land, you tie this cord of scarlet thread in the window through which you let us down, and gather into your house your father, your mother, your brothers, and all your father’s household.","19":"“And it shall come about that anyone who goes out of the doors of your house outside will have his blood on his own head, and we will be innocent; but anyone who is with you in the house, his blood will be on our head if a hand is laid on him.","20":"“But if you tell this business of ours, then we shall be exempt from the oath which you have made us swear.”","21":"She then said, “According to your words, so be it.” So she sent them away, and they departed; and she tied the scarlet cord in the window.","22":"So they departed and came to the hill country, and remained there for three days, until the pursuers returned. Now the pursuers had searched for them all along the road, but had not found them.","23":"Then the two men returned and came down from the hill country, and they crossed over and came to Joshua the son of Nun. Then they reported to him all that had happened to them.","24":"And they said to Joshua, “The LORD has indeed handed over to us all the land; furthermore, all the inhabitants of the land have despaired because of us.”"},"3":{"1":"Then Joshua got up early in the morning; and he and all the sons of Israel set out from Shittim and came to the Jordan, and they spent the night there before they crossed.","2":"Then at the end of three days the officers went through the midst of the camp;","3":"and they commanded the people, saying, “When you see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God with the Levitical priests carrying it, then you shall set out from your place and go after it.","4":"“However, there shall be a distance between you and it of about two thousand cubits by measurement. Do not come near it, so that you may know the way by which you shall go, for you have not passed this way before.”","5":"Then Joshua said to the people, “Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the LORD will do miracles among you.”","6":"And Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, “Take up the ark of the covenant and cross over ahead of the people.” So they took up the ark of the covenant and went ahead of the people.","7":"Now the LORD said to Joshua, “This day I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, so that they will know that just as I have been with Moses, I will be with you.","8":"“So you shall command the priests who are carrying the ark of the covenant, saying, ‘When you come to the edge of the waters of the Jordan, you shall stand still in the Jordan.’”","9":"Then Joshua said to the sons of Israel, “Come here, and hear the words of the LORD your God.”","10":"And Joshua said, “By this you will know that the living God is among you, and that He will assuredly drive out from you the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Hivite, the Perizzite, the Girgashite, the Amorite, and the Jebusite.","11":"“Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is crossing over ahead of you into the Jordan.","12":"“Now then, take for yourselves twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one man for each tribe.","13":"“And it will come about when the soles of the feet of the priests who carry the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth, rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan will be cut off, that is, the waters which are flowing down from above; and they will stand in one heap.”","14":"So when the people set out from their tents to cross the Jordan, with the priests carrying the ark of the covenant before the people,","15":"and when those who were carrying the ark came up to the Jordan and the feet of the priests carrying the ark stepped down into the edge of the water (for the Jordan overflows all its banks all the days of harvest),","16":"then the waters which were flowing down from above stood and rose up in one heap, a great distance away at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan; and those which were flowing down toward the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, were completely cut off. So the people crossed opposite Jericho.","17":"And the priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan while all Israel crossed on dry ground, until all the nation had finished crossing the Jordan."},"4":{"1":"Now when the entire nation had finished crossing the Jordan, the LORD spoke to Joshua, saying,","2":"“Take for yourselves twelve men from the people, one man from each tribe,","3":"and command them, saying, ‘Take up for yourselves twelve stones from here out of the middle of the Jordan, from the place where the priests’ feet are standing firmly, and carry them over with you and lay them down in the encampment where you will spend the night.’”","4":"So Joshua called the twelve men whom he had appointed from the sons of Israel, one man from each tribe;","5":"and Joshua said to them, “Cross again to the ark of the LORD your God into the middle of the Jordan, and each of you take up a stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel.","6":"“This shall be a sign among you; when your children ask later, saying, ‘What do these stones mean to you?’","7":"then you shall say to them, ‘That the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it crossed the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off.’ So these stones shall become a memorial to the sons of Israel forever.”","8":"So the sons of Israel did exactly as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan, just as the LORD spoke to Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel; and they carried them over with them to the encampment and put them down there.","9":"Then Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan at the place where the feet of the priests who carried the ark of the covenant were standing, and they are there to this day.","10":"For the priests who carried the ark were standing in the middle of the Jordan until everything was completed that the LORD had commanded Joshua to speak to the people, according to all that Moses had commanded Joshua. And the people hurried and crossed;","11":"and when all the people had finished crossing, then the ark of the LORD and the priests crossed in front of the people.","12":"The sons of Reuben, the sons of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over in battle formation before the sons of Israel, just as Moses had spoken to them;","13":"about forty thousand equipped for war, crossed for battle before the LORD to the desert plains of Jericho.","14":"On that day the LORD exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel, so that they revered him, just as they had revered Moses all the days of his life.","15":"Now the LORD said to Joshua,","16":"“Command the priests who carry the ark of the testimony that they come up from the Jordan.”","17":"So Joshua commanded the priests, saying, “Come up from the Jordan.”","18":"It came about when the priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD had come up from the middle of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests’ feet were lifted up to the dry ground, that the waters of the Jordan returned to their place, and went over all its banks as before.","19":"Now the people came up from the Jordan on the tenth of the first month and camped at Gilgal, on the eastern edge of Jericho.","20":"As for those twelve stones which they had taken from the Jordan, Joshua set them up at Gilgal.","21":"And he said to the sons of Israel, “When your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, ‘What are these stones?’","22":"then you shall inform your children, saying, ‘Israel crossed this Jordan on dry ground.’","23":"“For the LORD your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you until you had crossed, just as the LORD your God had done to the Red Sea, which He dried up before us until we had crossed;","24":"so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the hand of the LORD is mighty, so that you may fear the LORD your God forever.”"},"5":{"1":"Now it came about when all the kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan to the west, and all the kings of the Canaanites who were by the sea, heard how the LORD had dried up the waters of the Jordan before the sons of Israel until they had crossed, that their hearts melted, and there was no spirit in them any longer because of the sons of Israel.","2":"At that time the LORD said to Joshua, “Make for yourself flint knives and circumcise again the sons of Israel the second time.”","3":"So Joshua made himself flint knives and circumcised the sons of Israel at Gibeath-haaraloth.","4":"This is the reason why Joshua circumcised them: all the people who came out of Egypt who were males, all the men of war, died in the wilderness along the way after they came out of Egypt.","5":"For all the people who came out were circumcised, but all the people who were born in the wilderness along the way as they came out of Egypt had not been circumcised.","6":"For the sons of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, until all the nation, that is, the men of war who came out of Egypt, perished because they did not listen to the voice of the LORD, to whom the LORD had sworn that He would not let them see the land which the LORD had sworn to their fathers to give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.","7":"So their children whom He raised up in their place, Joshua circumcised; for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them along the way.","8":"Now when they had finished circumcising all the nation, they remained in their places in the camp until they recovered.","9":"Then the LORD said to Joshua, “Today I have rolled away the shame of Egypt from you.” So the name of that place is called Gilgal to this day.","10":"While the sons of Israel camped at Gilgal they celebrated the Passover on the evening of the fourteenth day of the month on the desert plains of Jericho.","11":"Then on the day after the Passover, on that very day, they ate some of the produce of the land, unleavened cakes and roasted grain.","12":"And the manna ceased on the day after they had eaten some of the produce of the land, so that the sons of Israel no longer had manna, but they ate some of the yield of the land of Canaan during that year.","13":"Now it came about when Joshua was by Jericho, he raised his eyes and looked, and behold, a man was standing opposite him with his sword drawn in his hand, and Joshua went to him and said to him, “Are you for us or for our enemies?”","14":"He said, “No; rather I have come now as captain of the army of the LORD.” And Joshua fell on his face to the ground, and bowed down, and said to him, “What has my lord to say to his servant?”","15":"And the captain of the LORD’S army said to Joshua, “Remove your sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy.” And Joshua did so."},"6":{"1":"Now Jericho was tightly shut because of the sons of Israel; no one went out and no one came in.","2":"But the LORD said to Joshua, “See, I have handed Jericho over to you, with its king and the valiant warriors.","3":"“And you shall march around the city, all the men of war circling the city once. You shall do so for six days.","4":"“Also seven priests shall carry seven trumpets of rams’ horns in front of the ark; then on the seventh day you shall march around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets.","5":"“It shall be that when they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, and when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city will fall down flat, and the people shall go up, everyone straight ahead.”","6":"So Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and said to them, “Take up the ark of the covenant, and have seven priests carry seven trumpets of rams’ horns in front of the ark of the LORD.”","7":"Then he said to the people, “Go forward and march around the city, and the armed men shall go on ahead of the ark of the LORD.”","8":"And it was so, that when Joshua had spoken to the people, the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the LORD went forward and blew the trumpets; and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them.","9":"And the armed men went ahead of the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard came after the ark, while they continued to blow the trumpets.","10":"But Joshua commanded the people, saying, “You shall not shout nor let your voice be heard, nor let a word proceed from your mouth, until the day I tell you, ‘Shout!’ Then you shall shout!”","11":"So he had the ark of the LORD taken around the city, circling it once; then they came into the camp and spent the night in the camp.","12":"Now Joshua got up early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD.","13":"Then the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets of rams’ horns in front of the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew the trumpets; and the armed men went ahead of them, and the rear guard came after the ark of the LORD, while they continued to blow the trumpets.","14":"So the second day they marched around the city once and returned to the camp; they did the same for six days.","15":"Then on the seventh day they got up early at the dawning of the day and marched around the city in the same way seven times; only on that day did they march around the city seven times.","16":"And at the seventh time, when the priests blew the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, “Shout! For the LORD has given you the city.","17":"“But the city shall be designated for destruction, it and everything that is in it belongs to the LORD; only Rahab the prostitute and all who are with her in the house shall live, because she hid the messengers whom we sent.","18":"“But as for you, only keep yourselves from the things designated for destruction, so that you do not covet them and take some of the designated things, and turn the camp of Israel into something designated for destruction and bring disaster on it.","19":"“But all the silver and gold, and articles of bronze and iron are holy to the LORD; they shall go into the treasury of the LORD.”","20":"So the people shouted, and the priests blew the trumpets; and when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, everyone straight ahead, and they took the city.","21":"They utterly destroyed everything in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, sheep, and donkey, with the edge of the sword.","22":"And Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, “Go into the prostitute’s house and bring the woman and all she has out of there, just as you have sworn to her.”","23":"So the young men who were spies went in and brought out Rahab, her father, her mother, her brothers, and all she had; they also brought out all her relatives, and placed them outside the camp of Israel.","24":"Then they burned the city with fire, and all that was in it. Only the silver and gold, and the articles of bronze and iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.","25":"However, Rahab the prostitute and her father’s household and all she had, Joshua spared; and she has lived in the midst of Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.","26":"Then Joshua made them take an oath at that time, saying, “Cursed before the LORD is the man who rises up and builds this city Jericho; with the loss of his firstborn he will lay its foundation, and with the loss of his youngest son he will set up its gates.”","27":"So the LORD was with Joshua, and his fame was in all the land."},"7":{"1":"But the sons of Israel acted unfaithfully regarding the things designated for destruction, for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, from the tribe of Judah, took some of the designated things; therefore the anger of the LORD burned against the sons of Israel.","2":"Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth-aven, east of Bethel, and said to them, “Go up and spy out the land.” So the men went up and spied out Ai.","3":"Then they returned to Joshua and said to him, “Do not have all the people go up; have only about two or three thousand men go up and attack Ai; do not trouble all the people there, for they are few.”","4":"So about three thousand men from the people went up there, but they fled from the men of Ai.","5":"And the men of Ai struck and killed about thirty-six of their men, and pursued them from the gate as far as Shebarim and struck them on the mountainside; and the hearts of the people melted and became like water.","6":"Then Joshua tore his clothes and fell to the ground on his face before the ark of the LORD until the evening, both he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust on their heads.","7":"And Joshua said, “Oh, Lord GOD! Why did You ever bring this people across the Jordan, only to hand us over to the Amorites, to eliminate us? If only we had been willing to live beyond the Jordan!","8":"“O Lord, what can I say since Israel has turned their back before their enemies?","9":"“For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear about it, and they will surround us and eliminate our name from the earth. And what will You do for Your great name?”","10":"So the LORD said to Joshua, “Stand up! Why is it that you have fallen on your face?","11":"“Israel has sinned, and they have also violated My covenant which I commanded them. And they have even taken some of the things designated for destruction, and have both stolen and kept it a secret. Furthermore, they have also put them among their own things.","12":"“Therefore the sons of Israel cannot stand against their enemies; they turn their backs before their enemies, because they have become designated for destruction. I will not be with you anymore unless you eliminate from your midst the things designated for destruction.","13":"“Stand up! Consecrate the people and say, ‘Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, because the LORD, the God of Israel, has said this: “There are things designated for destruction in your midst, Israel. You cannot stand against your enemies until you have removed the designated things from your midst.”","14":"‘So in the morning you shall come forward by your tribes. And it shall be that the tribe which the LORD selects by lot shall come forward by families, and the family which the LORD selects shall come forward by households, and the household which the LORD selects shall come forward man by man.","15":"‘And it shall be that the one who is selected with the things designated for destruction shall be burned with fire, he and all that belongs to him, because he has violated the covenant of the LORD, and because he has committed a disgraceful thing in Israel.’”","16":"So Joshua got up early in the morning and brought Israel forward by tribes, and the tribe of Judah was selected.","17":"So he brought the family of Judah forward, and he selected the family of the Zerahites; then he brought the family of the Zerahites forward man by man, and Zabdi was selected.","18":"And he brought his household forward man by man; and Achan, son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, from the tribe of Judah, was selected.","19":"Then Joshua said to Achan, “My son, I implore you, give glory to the LORD, the God of Israel, and give praise to Him; and tell me now what you have done. Do not hide it from me.”","20":"So Achan answered Joshua and said, “Truly, I have sinned against the LORD, the God of Israel, and this is what I did:","21":"when I saw among the spoils a beautiful robe from Shinar, two hundred shekels of silver, and a bar of gold fifty shekels in weight, then I wanted them and took them; and behold, they are hidden in the ground inside my tent, with the silver underneath.”","22":"So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and behold, it was hidden in his tent with the silver underneath it.","23":"So they took them from inside the tent and brought them to Joshua and to all the sons of Israel; and they laid them out before the LORD.","24":"Then Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, the silver, the robe, the bar of gold, his sons, his daughters, his oxen, his donkeys, his sheep, his tent, and all that belonged to him; and they brought them up to the Valley of Achor.","25":"And Joshua said, “Why have you brought disaster on us? The LORD will bring disaster on you this day.” And all Israel stoned them with stones; and they burned them with fire after they had stoned them with stones.","26":"Then they erected over him a large heap of stones that stands to this day, and the LORD turned from the fierceness of His anger. Therefore the name of that place has been called the Valley of Achor to this day."},"8":{"1":"Now the LORD said to Joshua, “Do not fear or be dismayed. Take all the people of war with you. Arise, go up to Ai; see, I have handed over to you the king of Ai, his people, his city, and his land.","2":"“You shall do to Ai and its king just as you did to Jericho and its king; you shall take only its spoils and its cattle as plunder for yourselves. Set an ambush for the city behind it.”","3":"So Joshua rose up with all the people of war to go up to Ai; and Joshua chose thirty thousand men, valiant warriors, and sent them out at night.","4":"He commanded them, saying, “See, you are going to ambush the city from behind it. Do not go very far from the city, but all of you be ready.","5":"“Then I and all the people who are with me will approach the city. And when they come out to meet us as they did the first time, we will flee before them.","6":"“They will come out after us until we have lured them away from the city, for they will say, ‘They are fleeing before us just as they did the first time.’ So we will flee before them.","7":"“Then you shall rise from your ambush and take possession of the city, for the LORD your God will hand it over to you.","8":"“Then it will be when you have seized the city, that you shall set the city on fire. You shall do it in accordance with the word of the LORD. See, I have commanded you.”","9":"So Joshua sent them away, and they went to the place of ambush and remained between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai; but Joshua spent that night among the people.","10":"Now Joshua got up early in the morning and mustered the people, and he went up with the elders of Israel before the people to Ai.","11":"Then all the people of war who were with him went up and approached, and arrived in front of the city; and they camped on the north side of Ai. And there was a valley between him and Ai.","12":"Then he took about five thousand men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.","13":"So they stationed the people, all the army that was on the north side of the city, and its rear guard on the west side of the city, and Joshua spent that night in the midst of the valley.","14":"And it came about, when the king of Ai saw them, that the men of the city hurried and got up early, and went out to meet Israel in battle, he and all his people at the appointed place before the desert plain. But he did not know that there was an ambush against him behind the city.","15":"Then Joshua and all Israel pretended to be defeated before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.","16":"And all the people who were in the city were called together to pursue them, and they pursued Joshua and were lured away from the city.","17":"So not a man was left in Ai or Bethel, but they had all gone out after Israel, and they left the city unguarded and pursued Israel.","18":"Then the LORD said to Joshua, “Reach out with the sword that is in your hand toward Ai, for I will hand it over to you.” So Joshua reached out with the sword that was in his hand toward the city.","19":"Then the men in ambush rose quickly from their place, and when he had reached out with his hand, they ran and entered the city and captured it, and they quickly set the city on fire.","20":"When the men of Ai turned back and looked, behold, the smoke of the city ascended to the sky, and they had no place to flee this way or that, for the people who had been fleeing to the wilderness turned against the pursuers.","21":"When Joshua and all Israel saw that the men in ambush had captured the city and that the smoke of the city ascended, they turned back and killed the men of Ai.","22":"The others came out from the city to confront them, so that they were trapped in the midst of Israel, some on this side and some on that side; and they killed them until there was not one left who escaped or survived.","23":"But they captured the king of Ai alive and brought him to Joshua.","24":"Now when Israel had finished killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the field in the wilderness where they pursued them, and all of them had fallen by the edge of the sword until they were destroyed, then all Israel returned to Ai and struck it with the edge of the sword.","25":"So all who fell that day, both men and women, were twelve thousand—all the people of Ai.","26":"For Joshua did not withdraw his hand with which he reached out with the sword until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.","27":"Israel took only the cattle and the spoils of that city as plunder for themselves, in accordance with the word of the LORD which He had commanded Joshua.","28":"So Joshua burned Ai and made it a refuse heap forever, a desolation until this day.","29":"And he hanged the king of Ai on a tree until evening; but at sunset Joshua gave the command and they took his body down from the tree and threw it at the entrance of the city gate, and erected over it a large heap of stones that stands to this day.","30":"Then Joshua built an altar to the LORD, the God of Israel, on Mount Ebal,","31":"just as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded the sons of Israel, as it is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, an altar of uncut stones on which no one had wielded an iron tool; and they offered burnt offerings on it to the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings.","32":"And he wrote there on the stones a copy of the Law of Moses, which he had written, in the presence of the sons of Israel.","33":"And all Israel with their elders, officers, and their judges were standing on both sides of the ark before the Levitical priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD, the stranger as well as the native.

So he died.","22":"And behold, while Barak was pursuing Sisera, Jael came out to meet him and said to him, “Come, and I will show you the man whom you are seeking.” So he entered with her, and behold, Sisera was lying dead with the tent peg in his temple.","23":"So God subdued Jabin the king of Canaan on that day before the sons of Israel.","24":"And the hand of the sons of Israel pressed harder and harder upon Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had eliminated Jabin the king of Canaan."},"5":{"1":"Then Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam sang on that day, saying,","2":"“For the leaders leading in Israel,\nFor the people volunteering,\nBless the LORD!","3":"“Hear, you kings; listen, you dignitaries!\nI myself—to the LORD, I myself will sing,\nI will sing praise to the LORD, the God of Israel!","4":"“LORD, when You went out from Seir,\nWhen You marched from the field of Edom,\nThe earth quaked, the heavens also dripped,\nThe clouds also dripped water.","5":"“The mountains flowed with water at the presence of the LORD,\nThis Sinai, at the presence of the LORD, the God of Israel.","6":"“In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath,\nIn the days of Jael, the roads were deserted,\nAnd travelers went by roundabout ways.","7":"“The peasantry came to an end, they came to an end in Israel,\nUntil I, Deborah, arose,\nUntil I arose, a mother in Israel.","8":"“New gods were chosen;\nThen war was in the gates.\nNot a shield or a spear was seen\nAmong forty thousand in Israel.","9":"“My heart goes out to the commanders of Israel,\nThe volunteers among the people;\nBless the LORD!","10":"“You who ride on white donkeys,\nYou who sit on rich carpets,\nAnd you who travel on the road—shout in praise!","11":"“At the sound of those who distribute water among the watering places,\nThere they will recount the righteous deeds of the LORD,\nThe righteous deeds for His peasantry in Israel.\nThen the people of the LORD went down to the gates.","12":"“Awake, awake, Deborah;\nAwake, awake, sing a song!\nArise, Barak, and lead away your captives, son of Abinoam.","13":"“Then survivors came down to the nobles;\nThe people of the LORD came down to me as warriors.","14":"“From Ephraim those whose root is in Amalek came down,\nFollowing you, Benjamin, with your peoples;\nFrom Machir commanders came down,\nAnd from Zebulun those who wield the staff of office.","15":"“And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah;\nAs was Issachar, so was Barak;\nInto the valley they rushed at his heels;\nAmong the divisions of Reuben\nThere were great determinations of heart.","16":"“Why did you sit among the sheepfolds,\nTo hear the piping for the flocks?\nAmong the divisions of Reuben\nThere were great searchings of heart.","17":"“Gilead remained across the Jordan;\nAnd why did Dan stay on ships?\nAsher sat at the seashore,\nAnd remained by its landings.","18":"“Zebulun was a people who risked their lives,\nAnd Naphtali too, on the high places of the field.","19":"“The kings came and fought;\nThen the kings of Canaan fought\nAt Taanach near the waters of Megiddo;\nThey took no plunder in silver.","20":"“The stars fought from heaven,\nFrom their paths they fought against Sisera.","21":"“The torrent of Kishon swept them away,\nThe ancient torrent, the torrent Kishon.\nMy soul, march on with strength!","22":"“Then the horses’ hoofs beat\nFrom the galloping, the galloping of his mighty stallions.","23":"‘Curse Meroz,’ said the angel of the LORD,\n‘Utterly curse its inhabitants,\nBecause they did not come to the help of the LORD,\nTo the help of the LORD against the warriors.’","24":"“Most blessed of women is Jael,\nThe wife of Heber the Kenite;\nMost blessed is she of women in the tent.","25":"“He asked for water, she gave him milk;\nIn a magnificent bowl she brought him curds.","26":"“She reached out her hand for the tent peg,\nAnd her right hand for the workmen’s hammer.\nThen she struck Sisera, she smashed his head;\nAnd she shattered and pierced his temple.","27":"“Between her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay;\nBetween her feet he bowed, he fell;\nWhere he bowed, there he fell dead.","28":"“Out of the window she looked and wailed,\nThe mother of Sisera through the lattice,\n‘Why does his chariot delay in coming?\nWhy do the hoofbeats of his chariots delay?’","29":"“Her wise princesses would answer her,\nIndeed she repeats her words to herself,","30":"‘Are they not finding, are they not dividing the spoils?\nA concubine, two concubines for every warrior;\nTo Sisera a spoil of dyed cloth,\nA spoil of dyed cloth embroidered,\nDyed cloth of double embroidery on the neck of the plunderer?’","31":"“May all Your enemies perish in this way, LORD;\nBut may those who love Him be like the rising of the sun in its might.”\nAnd the land was at rest for forty years."},"6":{"1":"Then the sons of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD handed them over to Midian for seven years.","2":"The power of Midian prevailed against Israel. Because of Midian the sons of Israel made for themselves the dens which were in the mountains and the caves and the strongholds.","3":"For whenever Israel had sown, the Midianites would come up with the Amalekites and the people of the east and march against them.","4":"So they would camp against them and destroy the produce of the earth as far as Gaza, and leave no sustenance in Israel, nor a sheep, ox, or donkey.","5":"For they would come up with their livestock and their tents, they would come in like locusts in number, and both they and their camels were innumerable; and they came into the land to ruin it.","6":"So Israel was brought very low because of Midian, and the sons of Israel cried out to the LORD.","7":"Now it came about, when the sons of Israel cried out to the LORD on account of Midian,","8":"that the LORD sent a prophet to the sons of Israel, and he said to them, “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel says: ‘It was I who brought you up from Egypt, and brought you out of the house of slavery.","9":"‘And I rescued you from the hands of the Egyptians, and from the hands of all your oppressors, and I drove them out from you and gave you their land,","10":"and I said to you, “I am the LORD your God; you shall not fear the gods of the Amorites in whose land you live.” But you have not obeyed Me.’”","11":"Then the angel of the LORD came and sat under the oak that was in Ophrah, which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, as his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the wine press in order to save it from the Midianites.","12":"And the angel of the LORD appeared to him and said to him, “The LORD is with you, valiant warrior.”","13":"Then Gideon said to him, “O my lord, if the LORD is with us, why then has all this happened to us? And where are all His miracles which our fathers told us about, saying, ‘Did the LORD not bring us up from Egypt?’ But now the LORD has abandoned us and handed us over to Midian.”","14":"And the LORD looked at him and said, “Go in this strength of yours and save Israel from the hand of Midian. Have I not sent you?”","15":"But he said to Him, “O Lord, how am I to save Israel? Behold, my family is the least in Manasseh, and I am the youngest in my father’s house.”","16":"Yet the LORD said to him, “I will certainly be with you, and you will defeat Midian as one man.”","17":"So Gideon said to Him, “If now I have found favor in Your sight, then perform for me a sign that it is You speaking with me.","18":"“Please do not depart from here until I come back to You, and bring out my offering and lay it before You.” And He said, “I will remain until you return.”","19":"Then Gideon went in and prepared a young goat and unleavened bread from an ephah of flour; he put the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot, and brought them out to him under the oak and presented them.","20":"And the angel of God said to him, “Take the meat and the unleavened bread and lay them on this rock, and pour out the broth.” And he did so.","21":"Then the angel of the LORD put out the end of the staff that was in his hand and touched the meat and the unleavened bread; and fire came up from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened bread. Then the angel of the LORD vanished from his sight.","22":"When Gideon perceived that he was the angel of the LORD, he said, “Oh, Lord GOD! For I have seen the angel of the LORD face to face!”","23":"But the LORD said to him, “Peace to you, do not be afraid; you shall not die.”","24":"Then Gideon built an altar there to the LORD and named it The LORD is Peace. To this day it is still in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.","25":"Now on the same night the LORD said to him, “Take your father’s bull and a second bull seven years old, and tear down the altar of Baal which belongs to your father, and cut down the Asherah that is beside it;","26":"and build an altar to the LORD your God on the top of this stronghold in an orderly way, and take a second bull and offer a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah which you shall cut down.”","27":"Then Gideon took ten men from his servants and did as the LORD had spoken to him; and because he was too afraid of his father’s household and the men of the city to do it by day, he did it by night.","28":"When the people of the city got up early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal had been torn down, and the Asherah which had been beside it had been cut down, and the second bull had been offered on the altar which had been built.","29":"So they said to one another, “Who did this thing?” And when they searched and inquired, they said, “Gideon the son of Joash did this thing.”","30":"Then the men of the city said to Joash, “Bring out your son, that he may die, for he has torn down the altar of Baal, and indeed, he has cut down the Asherah which was beside it.”","31":"But Joash said to all who stood against him, “Will you contend for Baal, or will you save him? Whoever will contend for him shall be put to death by morning. If he is a god, let him contend for himself, since someone has torn down his altar!”","32":"Therefore on that day he named Gideon Jerubbaal, that is to say, “Let Baal contend against him,” because he had torn down his altar.","33":"Then all the Midianites, the Amalekites, and the people of the east assembled together; and they crossed over and camped in the Valley of Jezreel.","34":"So the Spirit of the LORD covered Gideon like clothing; and he blew a trumpet, and the Abiezrites were called together to follow him.","35":"And he sent messengers throughout Manasseh, and they also were called together to follow him; and he sent messengers to Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, and they came up to meet them.","36":"Then Gideon said to God, “If You are going to save Israel through me, as You have spoken,","37":"behold, I am putting a fleece of wool on the threshing floor. If there is dew on the fleece only, and it is dry on all the ground, then I will know that You will save Israel through me, as You have spoken.”","38":"And it was so. When he got up early the next morning and wrung out the fleece, he wrung the dew from the fleece, a bowl full of water.","39":"Then Gideon said to God, “Do not let Your anger burn against me, so that I may speak only one more time; please let me put You to the test only one more time with the fleece: let it now be dry only on the fleece, and let there be dew on all the ground.”","40":"And God did so that night; for it was dry only on the fleece, and dew was on all the ground."},"7":{"1":"Then Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) and all the people who were with him got up early, and camped beside the spring of Harod; and the camp of Midian was on the north side of them by the hill of Moreh in the valley.","2":"And the LORD said to Gideon, “The people who are with you are too many for Me to hand Midian over to them, otherwise Israel would become boastful, saying, ‘My own power has saved me.’","3":"“Now therefore come, proclaim in the hearing of the people, saying, ‘Whoever is afraid and worried, is to return and leave Mount Gilead.’” So twenty-two thousand from the people returned, but ten thousand remained.","4":"Then the LORD said to Gideon, “The people are still too many; bring them down to the water and I will test them for you there. So it shall be that he of whom I say to you, ‘This one shall go with you,’ he shall go with you; but everyone of whom I say to you, ‘This one shall not go with you,’ he shall not go.”","5":"So he brought the people down to the water. Then the LORD said to Gideon, “You shall put everyone who laps the water with his tongue as a dog laps in one group, and everyone who kneels down to drink in another.”","6":"Now the number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men; but all the rest of the people kneeled down to drink water.","7":"And the LORD said to Gideon, “I will save you with the three hundred men who lapped, and will hand the Midianites over to you; so have all the other people go, each man to his home.”","8":"So the three hundred men took the people’s provisions and their trumpets in their hands. And Gideon dismissed all the other men of Israel, each to his tent, but retained the three hundred men; and the camp of Midian was below him in the valley.","9":"Now on the same night it came about that the LORD said to him, “Arise, go down against the camp, for I have handed it over to you.","10":"“But if you are afraid to go down, go with Purah your servant down to the camp,","11":"so that you will hear what they say; and afterward you will have the courage to go down against the camp.” So he went down with Purah his servant to the outposts of the army that was in the camp.","12":"Now the Midianites, the Amalekites, and all the people of the east were lying in the valley as numerous as locusts; and their camels were without number, as numerous as the sand on the seashore.","13":"When Gideon came, behold, a man was relating a dream to his friend. And he said, “Behold, I had a dream; a loaf of barley bread was tumbling into the camp of Midian, and it came to the tent and struck it so that it fell, and turned it upside down so that the tent collapsed.”","14":"And his friend replied, “This is nothing other than the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel; God has handed over to him Midian and all the camp.”","15":"When Gideon heard the account of the dream and its interpretation, he bowed in worship. Then he returned to the camp of Israel and said, “Arise, for the LORD has handed over to you the camp of Midian!”","16":"And he divided the three hundred men into three units, and he put trumpets and empty pitchers into the hands of all of them, with torches inside the pitchers.","17":"Then he said to them, “Look at me and do likewise. And behold, when I come to the outskirts of the camp, do as I do.","18":"“When I and all who are with me blow the trumpet, then you also blow the trumpets around the entire camp and say, ‘For the LORD and for Gideon!’”","19":"So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the outskirts of the camp at the beginning of the middle night watch, when they had just posted the watch; and they blew the trumpets and smashed the pitchers that were in their hands.","20":"When the three units blew the trumpets and broke the pitchers, they held the torches in their left hands and the trumpets in their right hands for blowing, and shouted, “A sword for the LORD and for Gideon!”","21":"And each stood in his place around the camp; and all the army ran, crying out as they fled.","22":"And when they blew the three hundred trumpets, the LORD set the sword of one against another even throughout the entire army; and the army fled as far as Beth-shittah toward Zererah, as far as the edge of Abel-meholah, by Tabbath.","23":"And the men of Israel were summoned from Naphtali, Asher, and all Manasseh, and they pursued Midian.","24":"Then Gideon sent messengers throughout the hill country of Ephraim, saying, “Come down against Midian and take control of the waters ahead of them, as far as Beth-barah and the Jordan.” So all the men of Ephraim were summoned, and they took control of the waters as far as Beth-barah and the Jordan.","25":"And they captured the two leaders of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb, and they killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and they killed Zeeb at the wine press of Zeeb, while they pursued Midian; and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon from across the Jordan."},"8":{"1":"Then the men of Ephraim said to Gideon, “What is this thing that you have done to us, not calling upon us when you went to fight against Midian?” And they quarreled with him vehemently.","2":"But he said to them, “What have I done now in comparison with you? Is the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim not better than the vintage of Abiezer?","3":"“God has handed over to you the leaders of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and what was I able to do in comparison with you?” Then their anger toward him subsided when he said that.","4":"Then Gideon and the three hundred men who were with him came to the Jordan and crossed over, exhausted yet still pursuing.","5":"And he said to the men of Succoth, “Please give loaves of bread to the people who are following me, for they are exhausted, and I am pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.”","6":"But the leaders of Succoth said, “Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hand, that we should give bread to your army?”","7":"So Gideon said, “For this answer, when the LORD has handed over to me Zebah and Zalmunna, I will thrash your bodies with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.”","8":"Then he went up from there to Penuel and spoke similarly to them; and the men of Penuel answered him just as the men of Succoth had answered.","9":"So he said also to the men of Penuel, “When I return safely, I will tear down this tower.”","10":"Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their armies with them, about fifteen thousand men, all who were left of the entire army of the people of the east; for the fallen were 120,000 swordsmen.","11":"Gideon went up by the way of those who lived in tents to the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and he attacked the camp when the camp was unsuspecting.","12":"When Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued them and captured the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and routed the entire army.","13":"Then Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle by the ascent of Heres.","14":"And he captured a youth from Succoth and questioned him. Then the youth wrote down for him the leaders of Succoth and its elders, seventy-seven men.","15":"And he came to the men of Succoth and said, “Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you taunted me, saying, ‘Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hand, that we should give bread to your men who are weary?’”","16":"Then he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and he disciplined the men of Succoth with them.","17":"And he tore down the tower of Penuel and killed the men of the city.","18":"Then he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, “Where were the men whom you killed at Tabor?” But they said, “You and they were alike, each one resembling the son of a king.”","19":"And he said, “They were my brothers, the sons of my mother. As the LORD lives, if only you had let them live, I would not kill you.”","20":"So he said to Jether his firstborn, “Rise, kill them.” But the youth did not draw his sword, for he was afraid, because he was still a youth.","21":"Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, “Rise up yourself, and attack us; for as the man, so is his strength.” So Gideon arose and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescent amulets which were on their camels’ necks.","22":"Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, “Rule over us, both you and your son, your son’s son as well, for you have saved us from the hand of Midian!”","23":"But Gideon said to them, “I will not rule over you, nor shall my son rule over you; the LORD shall rule over you.”","24":"Yet Gideon said to them, “I would request of you, that each of you give me an earring from his plunder.” (For they had gold earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)","25":"And they said, “We will certainly give them to you.” So they spread out a garment, and every one of them tossed an earring there from his plunder.","26":"The weight of the gold earrings that he requested was 1,700 shekels of gold, apart from the crescent amulets, the ear pendants, and the purple robes which were on the kings of Midian, and apart from the neck chains that were on their camels’ necks.","27":"Gideon made it into an ephod, and placed it in his city, Ophrah; but all Israel committed infidelity with it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and his household.","28":"So Midian was subdued before the sons of Israel, and they did not lift up their heads anymore. And the land was undisturbed for forty years in the days of Gideon.","29":"Then Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and lived in his own house.","30":"Now Gideon had seventy sons who were his direct descendants, for he had many wives.","31":"And his concubine who was in Shechem also bore him a son, and he named him Abimelech.","32":"And Gideon the son of Joash died at a good old age and was buried in the tomb of his father Joash, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.","33":"Then it came about, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the sons of Israel again committed infidelity with the Baals, and made Baal-berith their god.","34":"So the sons of Israel did not remember the LORD their God, who had saved them from the hands of all their enemies on every side;","35":"nor did they show kindness to the household of Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) in accordance with all the good that he had done for Israel."},"9":{"1":"Now Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem, to his mother’s relatives, and spoke to them and to the entire family of the household of his mother’s father, saying,","2":"“Speak, now, in the hearing of all the leaders of Shechem, ‘Which is better for you: for seventy men, all the sons of Jerubbaal, to rule over you, or for one man to rule over you?’ Also, remember that I am your bone and your flesh.”","3":"So his mother’s relatives spoke all these words on his behalf in the hearing of all the leaders of Shechem; and they were inclined to follow Abimelech, for they said, “He is our relative.”","4":"And they gave him seventy pieces of silver from the house of Baal-berith, with which Abimelech hired worthless and reckless men, and they followed him.","5":"Then he went to his father’s house in Ophrah and killed his brothers the sons of Jerubbaal, seventy men, on one stone. But Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left, because he hid himself.","6":"All the leaders of Shechem and all Beth-millo assembled together, and they went and made Abimelech king, by the oak of the memorial stone which was in Shechem.","7":"Now when they told Jotham, he went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim, and raised his voice and called out. And he said to them, “Listen to me, you leaders of Shechem, that God may listen to you.","8":"“Once the trees went to anoint a king over them, and they said to the olive tree, ‘Reign over us!’","9":"“But the olive tree said to them, ‘Shall I give up my fatness with which God and mankind are honored, and go to wave over the trees?’","10":"“Then the trees said to the fig tree, ‘You, come, reign over us!’","11":"“But the fig tree said to them, ‘Shall I give up my sweetness and my good fruit, and go to wave over the trees?’","12":"“Then the trees said to the vine, ‘You, come, reign over us!’","13":"“But the vine said to them, ‘Shall I give up my new wine, which cheers God and mankind, and go to wave over the trees?’","14":"“Then all the trees said to the bramble, ‘You, come, reign over us!’","15":"“And the bramble said to the trees, ‘If you really are anointing me as king over you, come and take refuge in my shade; but if not, may fire come out of the bramble and consume the cedars of Lebanon.’","16":"“Now then, if you have acted with honesty and integrity in making Abimelech king, and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have dealt with him as he deserved—","17":"for my father fought for you, and risked his life and saved you from the hand of Midian;","18":"but in fact you have risen against my father’s house today and have killed his sons, seventy men, on one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his female slave, king over the leaders of Shechem, because he is your relative—","19":"so if you have acted with honesty and integrity toward Jerubbaal and his house this day, be joyful about Abimelech, and may he also be joyful about you.","20":"“But if not, may fire come out of Abimelech and consume the leaders of Shechem and Beth-millo; and may fire come out of the leaders of Shechem and from Beth-millo, and consume Abimelech.”","21":"Then Jotham escaped and fled, and went to Beer; and he stayed there because of his brother Abimelech.","22":"Now Abimelech ruled over Israel for three years.","23":"Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the leaders of Shechem; and the leaders of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech,","24":"so that the violence done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal would come, and the responsibility for their blood would be placed on their brother Abimelech, who killed them, and on the leaders of Shechem, who encouraged him to kill his brothers.","25":"The leaders of Shechem set up men in ambush against him on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed everyone who would pass by them on the road; and it was reported to Abimelech.","26":"Now Gaal the son of Ebed came with his relatives, and crossed over into Shechem; and the leaders of Shechem trusted him.","27":"So they went out to the field and gathered the grapes of their vineyards and trampled them, and held a festival; and they went into the house of their god, and ate and drank and cursed Abimelech.","28":"Then Gaal the son of Ebed said, “Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? Is he not the son of Jerubbaal, and is Zebul not his governor? Serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem; but why should we serve him?","29":"“If only this people were under my authority! Then I would do away with Abimelech.” And he said to Abimelech, “Enlarge your army and come out!”","30":"When Zebul the leader of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger burned.","31":"So using deception, he successfully sent messengers to Abimelech, saying, “Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his relatives have come to Shechem; and behold, they are stirring up the city against you.","32":"“So now, arise by night, you and the people who are with you, and lie in wait in the field.","33":"“Then in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, you shall rise early and attack the city; and behold, when he and the people who are with him come out against you, you shall do to them whatever you can.”","34":"So Abimelech and all the people who were with him got up at night, and lay in wait against Shechem, in four units.","35":"Now Gaal the son of Ebed went out and stood at the entrance of the city gate; and Abimelech and the people who were with him arose from the ambush.","36":"When Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, “Look, people are coming down from the tops of the mountains.” But Zebul said to him, “You are seeing the shadow of the mountains as if they were people.”","37":"And Gaal spoke yet again and said, “Look, people are coming down from the highest part of the land, and one unit is coming by way of the diviners’ oak.”","38":"Then Zebul said to him, “Where then is your boasting with which you said, ‘Who is Abimelech that we should serve him?’ Is this not the people whom you rejected? Go out now and fight them!”","39":"So Gaal went out in the sight of the leaders of Shechem and fought Abimelech.","40":"But Abimelech chased him, and he fled from him; and many fell wounded up to the entrance of the gate.","41":"Then Abimelech stayed in Arumah, but Zebul drove out Gaal and his relatives so that they could not stay in Shechem.","42":"Now it came about the next day, that the people went out to the field, and it was reported to Abimelech.","43":"So he took his people and divided them into three units, and lay in wait in the field; when he looked and saw the people coming out from the city, he attacked them and killed them.","44":"Then Abimelech and the company who was with him rushed forward and stood at the entrance of the city gate; the other two companies then attacked all who were in the field and killed them.","45":"Abimelech fought against the city that whole day, and he captured the city and killed the people who were in it; then he tore down the city and sowed it with salt.","46":"When all the leaders of the tower of Shechem heard about it, they entered the inner chamber of the temple of El-berith.","47":"And it was reported to Abimelech that all the leaders of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.","48":"So Abimelech went up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the people who were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand and cut down a branch from the trees, and lifted it and put it on his shoulder. Then he said to the people who were with him, “What you saw me do, hurry and do likewise.”","49":"So all the people also cut down, each one, his branch and followed Abimelech, and put them on top of the inner chamber and set the inner chamber on fire over those inside, so that all the people of the tower of Shechem also died, about a thousand men and women.","50":"Then Abimelech went to Thebez, and he camped against Thebez and captured it.","51":"But there was a strong tower in the center of the city, and all the men and women with all the leaders of the city fled there and shut themselves in; and they went up on the roof of the tower.","52":"So Abimelech came to the tower and fought against it, and approached the entrance of the tower to burn it down with fire.","53":"But a woman threw an upper millstone on Abimelech’s head, crushing his skull.","54":"Then he called quickly to the young man, his armor bearer, and said to him, “Draw your sword and kill me, so that it will not be said of me, ‘A woman killed him.’” So the young man pierced him through, and he died.","55":"Now when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, each left for his home.","56":"So God repaid the wickedness of Abimelech, which he had done to his father in killing his seventy brothers.","57":"God also returned all the wickedness of the men of Shechem on their heads, and the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal came upon them."},"10":{"1":"Now after Abimelech died, Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar, rose up to save Israel; and he lived in Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim.","2":"He judged Israel for twenty-three years.

And the sons of Israel gathered together and camped in Mizpah.","18":"And the people, the leaders of Gilead, said to one another, “Who is the man who will begin to fight against the sons of Ammon?

And about three thousand men and women were on the roof looking on while Samson was entertaining them.","28":"Then Samson called to the LORD and said, “Lord GOD, please remember me and please strengthen me just this time, O God, that I may at once take vengeance on the Philistines for my two eyes.”","29":"Then Samson grasped the two middle pillars on which the house rested, and braced himself against them, the one with his right hand and the other with his left.","30":"And Samson said, “Let me die with the Philistines!” And he pushed outwards powerfully, so that the house fell on the governors and all the people who were in it. And the dead whom he killed at his death were more than those whom he killed during his lifetime.","31":"Then his brothers and all his father’s household came down and took him, and brought him up and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of his father Manoah.

And what are you doing in this place? And what do you have here?”","4":"He said to them, “Micah has done this and that for me, and he has hired me and I have become his priest.”","5":"Then they said to him, “Inquire of God, please, that we may know whether our way on which we are going will be successful.”","6":"And the priest said to them, “Go in peace; your way in which you are going has the LORD’S approval.”","7":"So the five men departed and came to Laish, and saw the people who were in it living in security, in the way of the Sidonians, quiet and unsuspecting; for there was no oppressive ruler humiliating them for anything in the land, and they were far from the Sidonians and had no dealings with anyone.","8":"When they came back to their brothers at Zorah and Eshtaol, their brothers said to them, “What do you say?”","9":"And they said, “Arise, and let’s go up against them; for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very good.

Therefore they called that place Mahaneh-dan to this day; behold, it is west of Kiriath-jearim.","13":"And they passed from there to the hill country of Ephraim and came to the house of Micah.","14":"Then the five men who went to spy out the country of Laish said to their kinsmen, “Do you know that there are in these houses an ephod and household idols, and a carved image and a cast metal image? Now then, consider what you should do.”","15":"So they turned aside there and came to the house of the young man, the Levite, to the house of Micah, and asked him how he was doing.","16":"Meanwhile, the six hundred men armed with their weapons of war, who were of the sons of Dan, were positioned at the entrance of the gate.","17":"Now the five men who went to spy out the land went up and entered there; they took the carved image, the ephod, the household idols, and the cast metal image, while the priest was standing at the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men armed with weapons of war.","18":"When these men entered Micah’s house and took the carved image, the ephod, household idols, and the cast metal image, the priest said to them, “What are you doing?”","19":"And they said to him, “Be silent, put your hand over your mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest. Is it better for you to be a priest to the house of one man, or to be priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?”","20":"The priest’s heart was glad, and he took the ephod, the household idols, and the carved image, and went among the people.","21":"Then they turned and left, and put the children, the livestock, and the valuables in front of them.","22":"When they had distanced themselves from Micah’s house, the men who were in the houses near Micah’s house assembled by command and overtook the sons of Dan.","23":"Then they called out to the sons of Dan, who turned around and said to Micah, “What is the matter with you, that you have assembled together?”","24":"And he said, “You have taken my gods which I made, and the priest, and have gone away; what more do I have? So how can you say to me, ‘What is the matter with you?’”","25":"Then the sons of Dan said to him, “Do not let your voice be heard among us, or else fierce men will attack you, and you will lose your life and the lives of your household.”","26":"So the sons of Dan went on their way; and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his house.","27":"Then they took what Micah had made and the priest who had belonged to him, and came to Laish, to a people quiet and unsuspecting, and struck them with the edge of the sword; and they burned the city with fire.","28":"And there was no one to save them, because it was far from Sidon and they had no dealings with anyone, and it was in the valley which is near Beth-rehob. So they rebuilt the city and lived in it.","29":"And they named the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father who was born to Israel; however, the name of the city was previously Laish.","30":"The sons of Dan set up for themselves the carved image; and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land.","31":"So they set up for themselves Micah’s carved image which he had made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh."},"19":{"1":"Now it came about in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite staying in the remote part of the hill country of Ephraim, who took a concubine for himself from Bethlehem in Judah.","2":"But his concubine found him repugnant, and she left him and went to her father’s house in Bethlehem in Judah, and remained there for a period of four months.","3":"Then her husband set out and went after her to speak gently to her in order to bring her back, taking with him his servant and a pair of donkeys.

When you are thirsty, go to the water jars and drink from what the servants draw.”","10":"Then she fell on her face, bowing to the ground, and said to him, “Why have I found favor in your sight that you should take notice of me, since I am a foreigner?”","11":"Boaz replied to her, “All that you have done for your mother-in-law after the death of your husband has been fully reported to me, and how you left your father and your mother and the land of your birth, and came to a people that you did not previously know.","12":"“May the LORD reward your work, and may your wages be full from the LORD, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge.”","13":"Then she said, “I have found favor in your sight, my lord, for you have comforted me and indeed have spoken kindly to your servant, though I am not like one of your female servants.”","14":"And at mealtime Boaz said to her, “Come here, that you may eat of the bread and dip your piece of bread in the vinegar.” So she sat beside the reapers; and he served her roasted grain, and she ate and was satisfied and had some left.","15":"When she got up to glean, Boaz commanded his servants, saying, “Let her glean even among the sheaves, and do not insult her.","16":"“Also you are to purposely slip out for her some grain from the bundles and leave it so that she may glean, and do not rebuke her.”","17":"So she gleaned in the field until evening. Then she beat out what she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.","18":"And she picked it up and went into the city, and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned. She also took some out and gave Naomi what she had left after she was satisfied.","19":"Her mother-in-law then said to her, “Where did you glean today and where did you work? May he who took notice of you be blessed.” So she told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, and said, “The name of the man with whom I worked today is Boaz.”","20":"Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, “May he be blessed of the LORD who has not withdrawn His kindness from the living and from the dead.” Again Naomi said to her, “The man is our relative; he is one of our redeemers.”","21":"Then Ruth the Moabitess said, “Furthermore, he said to me, ‘You are to stay close to my servants until they have finished all my harvest.’”","22":"And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law Ruth, “It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his young women, so that others do not assault you in another field.”","23":"So she stayed close by the young women of Boaz in order to glean until the end of the barley harvest and the wheat harvest. And she lived with her mother-in-law."},"3":{"1":"Then her mother-in-law Naomi said to her, “My daughter, shall I not seek security for you, that it may go well for you?","2":"“Now then, is Boaz not our relative, with whose young women you were? Behold, he is winnowing barley at the threshing floor tonight.","3":"“Wash yourself therefore, and anoint yourself, and put on your best clothes, and go down to the threshing floor; but do not reveal yourself to the man until he has finished eating and drinking.","4":"“And it shall be when he lies down, that you shall take notice of the place where he lies, and you shall go and uncover his feet and lie down; then he will tell you what you should do.”","5":"And she said to her, “All that you say I will do.”","6":"So she went down to the threshing floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law had commanded her.","7":"When Boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was cheerful, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain; and she came secretly, and uncovered his feet and lay down.","8":"And it happened in the middle of the night that the man was startled and bent forward; and behold, a woman was lying at his feet.","9":"So he said, “Who are you?” And she answered, “I am Ruth your slave. Now spread your garment over your slave, for you are a redeemer.”","10":"Then he said, “May you be blessed of the LORD, my daughter. You have shown your last kindness to be better than the first, by not going after young men, whether poor or rich.","11":"“So now, my daughter, do not fear. I will do for you whatever you say, for all my people in the city know that you are a woman of excellence.","12":"“But now, although it is true that I am a redeemer, yet there is also a redeemer more closely related than I.","13":"“Remain this night, and when morning comes, if he will redeem you, good; let him redeem you. But if he does not wish to redeem you, then I will redeem you, as the LORD lives. Lie down until morning.”","14":"So she lay at his feet until morning, and got up before one person could recognize another; and he said, “Do not let it be known that the woman came to the threshing floor.”","15":"Again he said, “Give me the shawl that is on you and hold it.” So she held it, and he measured six measures of barley and laid it on her. Then she went into the city.","16":"When she came to her mother-in-law, she said, “How did it go, my daughter?” And she told her all that the man had done for her.","17":"She also said, “These six measures of barley he gave to me, for he said, ‘Do not go to your mother-in-law empty-handed.’”","18":"Then she said, “Wait, my daughter, until you know how the matter turns out; for the man will not rest until he has settled it today.”"},"4":{"1":"Now Boaz went up to the gate and sat down there, and behold, the redeemer of whom Boaz spoke was passing by, so he said, “Come over here, friend, sit down here.” And he came over and sat down.","2":"Then he took ten men of the elders of the city and said, “Sit down here.” So they sat down.","3":"And he said to the redeemer, “Naomi, who has returned from the land of Moab, has to sell the plot of land which belonged to our brother Elimelech.","4":"“So I thought that I would inform you, saying, ‘Buy it before those who are sitting here, and before the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, redeem it; but if not, tell me so that I may know; for there is no one except you to redeem it, and I am after you.’” And he said, “I will redeem it.”","5":"Then Boaz said, “On the day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi, you must also acquire Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of the deceased, in order to raise up the name of the deceased on his inheritance.”","6":"Then the redeemer said, “I cannot redeem it for myself, otherwise I would jeopardize my own inheritance. Redeem it for yourself; you may have my right of redemption, since I cannot redeem it.”","7":"Now this was the custom in former times in Israel concerning the redemption and the exchange of land to confirm any matter: a man removed his sandal and gave it to another; and this was the way of confirmation in Israel.","8":"So the redeemer said to Boaz, “Buy it for yourself.” And he removed his sandal.","9":"Then Boaz said to the elders and all the people, “You are witnesses today that I have bought from the hand of Naomi all that belonged to Elimelech and all that belonged to Chilion and Mahlon.","10":"“Furthermore, I have acquired Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of Mahlon, to be my wife in order to raise up the name of the deceased on his inheritance, so that the name of the deceased will not be eliminated from his brothers or from the court of his birth place; you are witnesses today.”","11":"And all the people who were in the court, and the elders, said, “We are witnesses. May the LORD make the woman who is coming into your home like Rachel and Leah, both of whom built the house of Israel; and may you achieve wealth in Ephrathah and become famous in Bethlehem.","12":"“Moreover, may your house be like the house of Perez whom Tamar bore to Judah, through the descendants whom the LORD will give you by this young woman.”","13":"So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife, and he had relations with her. And the LORD enabled her to conceive, and she gave birth to a son.","14":"Then the women said to Naomi, “Blessed is the LORD who has not left you without a redeemer today, and may his name become famous in Israel.","15":"“May he also be to you one who restores life and sustains your old age; for your daughter-in-law, who loves you and is better to you than seven sons, has given birth to him.”","16":"Then Naomi took the child and laid him in her lap, and became his nurse.","17":"And the neighbor women gave him a name, saying, “A son has been born to Naomi!” So they named him Obed. He is the father of Jesse, the father of David.","18":"Now these are the generations of Perez: Perez fathered Hezron,","19":"Hezron fathered Ram, and Ram fathered Amminadab,","20":"and Amminadab fathered Nahshon, and Nahshon fathered Salmon,","21":"and Salmon fathered Boaz, and Boaz fathered Obed,","22":"and Obed fathered Jesse, and Jesse fathered David."}},"1 Samuel":{"1":{"1":"Now there was a man from Ramathaim-zophim from the hill country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.","2":"And he had two wives: the name of one was Hannah and the name of the other Peninnah; and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.","3":"Now this man would go up from his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice to the LORD of armies in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests to the LORD there.","4":"When the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he would give portions to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters;","5":"but to Hannah he would give a double portion, because he loved Hannah, but the LORD had closed her womb.","6":"Her rival, moreover, would provoke her bitterly to irritate her, because the LORD had closed her womb.","7":"And it happened year after year, as often as she went up to the house of the LORD, that she would provoke her; so she wept and would not eat.","8":"Then Elkanah her husband would say to her, “Hannah, why do you weep, and why do you not eat, and why is your heart sad? Am I not better to you than ten sons?”","9":"Then Hannah got up after eating and drinking in Shiloh. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat by the doorpost of the temple of the LORD.","10":"She, greatly distressed, prayed to the LORD and wept bitterly.","11":"And she made a vow and said, “LORD of armies, if You will indeed look on the affliction of Your bond-servant and remember me, and not forget Your bond-servant, but will give Your bond-servant a son, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, and a razor shall never come on his head.”","12":"Now it came about, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli was watching her mouth.","13":"As for Hannah, she was speaking in her heart, only her lips were quivering, but her voice was not heard. So Eli thought that she was drunk.","14":"Then Eli said to her, “How long will you behave like a drunk? Get rid of your wine!”","15":"But Hannah answered and said, “No, my lord, I am a woman despairing in spirit; I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I have poured out my soul before the LORD.","16":"“Do not consider your bond-servant a useless woman, for I have spoken until now out of my great concern and provocation.”","17":"Then Eli answered and said, “Go in peace; and may the God of Israel grant your request that you have asked of Him.”","18":"She said, “Let your bond-servant find favor in your sight.” So the woman went on her way and ate, and her face was no longer sad.","19":"Then they got up early in the morning and worshiped before the LORD, and returned again to their house in Ramah. And Elkanah had relations with Hannah his wife, and the LORD remembered her.","20":"It came about in due time, after Hannah had conceived, that she gave birth to a son; and she named him Samuel, saying, “Because I have asked for him of the LORD.”","21":"Then the man Elkanah went up with all his household to offer to the LORD the yearly sacrifice and to pay his vow.","22":"But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, “I will not go until the child is weaned; then I will bring him, so that he may appear before the LORD and stay there for life.”","23":"Elkanah her husband said to her, “Do what seems best to you. Stay until you have weaned him; only may the LORD confirm His word.” So the woman stayed and nursed her son until she weaned him.","24":"Now when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with a three-year-old bull, one ephah of flour, and a jug of wine, and brought him to the house of the LORD in Shiloh, although the child was young.","25":"Then they slaughtered the bull, and brought the boy to Eli.","26":"And she said, “Pardon me, my lord! As your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman who stood here beside you, praying to the LORD.","27":"“For this boy I prayed, and the LORD has granted me my request which I asked of Him.","28":"“So I have also dedicated him to the LORD; as long as he lives he is dedicated to the LORD.” And he worshiped the LORD there."},"2":{"1":"Then Hannah prayed and said,\n“My heart rejoices in the LORD;\nMy horn is exalted in the LORD,\nMy mouth speaks boldly against my enemies,\nBecause I rejoice in Your salvation.","2":"“There is no one holy like the LORD,\nIndeed, there is no one besides You,\nNor is there any rock like our God.","3":"“Do not go on boasting so very proudly,\nDo not let arrogance come out of your mouth;\nFor the LORD is a God of knowledge,\nAnd with Him actions are weighed.","4":"“The bows of the mighty are broken to pieces,\nBut those who have stumbled strap on strength.","5":"“Those who were full hire themselves out for bread,\nBut those who were hungry cease to be hungry.\nEven the infertile woman gives birth to seven,\nBut she who has many children languishes.","6":"“The LORD puts to death and makes alive;\nHe brings down to Sheol and brings up.","7":"“The LORD makes poor and rich;\nHe humbles, He also exalts.","8":"“He raises the poor from the dust,\nHe lifts the needy from the garbage heap\nTo seat them with nobles,\nAnd He gives them a seat of honor as an inheritance;\nFor the pillars of the earth are the LORD’S,\nAnd He set the world on them.","9":"“He watches over the feet of His godly ones,\nBut the wicked ones are silenced in darkness;\nFor not by might shall a person prevail.","10":"“Those who contend with the LORD will be terrified;\nAgainst them He will thunder in the heavens,\nThe LORD will judge the ends of the earth;\nAnd He will give strength to His king,\nAnd will exalt the horn of His anointed.”","11":"Then Elkanah went to his home at Ramah. But the boy continued to attend to the service of the LORD before Eli the priest.","12":"Now the sons of Eli were useless men; they did not know the LORD.","13":"And this was the custom of the priests with the people: when anyone was offering a sacrifice, the priest’s servant would come while the meat was cooking, with a three-pronged fork in his hand.","14":"And he would thrust it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; everything that the fork brought up, the priest would take for himself. They did so in Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there.","15":"Also, before they burned the fat, the priest’s servant would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, “Give the priest meat for roasting, as he will not take cooked meat from you, only raw.”","16":"And if the man said to him, “They must burn the fat first, then take as much as you desire,” then he would say, “No, but you must give it to me now; and if not, I am taking it by force!”","17":"And so the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD, for the men treated the offering of the LORD disrespectfully.","18":"Now Samuel was ministering before the LORD, as a boy wearing a linen ephod.","19":"And his mother would make for him a little robe and bring it up to him from year to year when she would come up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.","20":"Then Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, and say, “May the LORD give you children from this woman in place of the one she requested of the LORD.” And they went to their own home.","21":"The LORD indeed visited Hannah, and she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. And the boy Samuel grew up before the LORD.","22":"Now Eli was very old; and he heard about everything that his sons were doing to all Israel, and that they slept with the women who served at the doorway of the tent of meeting.","23":"So he said to them, “Why are you doing such things as these, the evil things that I hear from all these people?","24":"“No, my sons; for the report is not good which I hear the LORD’S people circulating.","25":"“If one person sins against another, God will mediate for him; but if a person sins against the LORD, who can intercede for him?” But they would not listen to the voice of their father, for the LORD desired to put them to death.","26":"Now the boy Samuel was continuing to grow and to be in favor both with the LORD and with people.","27":"Then a man of God came to Eli and said to him, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Did I not indeed reveal Myself to the house of your father when they were in Egypt in bondage to Pharaoh’s house?","28":"‘Did I not choose them from all the tribes of Israel to be My priests, to go up to My altar, to burn incense, to carry an ephod before Me? And did I not give to the house of your father all the fire offerings of the sons of Israel?","29":"‘Why are you showing contempt for My sacrifice and My offering which I have commanded for My dwelling, and why are you honoring your sons above Me, by making yourselves fat with the choicest of every offering of My people Israel?’","30":"“Therefore the LORD God of Israel declares, ‘I did indeed say that your house and the house of your father was to walk before Me forever’; but now the LORD declares, ‘Far be it from Me—for those who honor Me I will honor, and those who despise Me will be insignificant.","31":"‘Behold, the days are coming when I will eliminate your strength and the strength of your father’s house, so that there will not be an old man in your house.","32":"‘And you will look at the distress of My dwelling, in spite of all the good that I do for Israel; and there will never be an old man in your house.","33":"‘Yet I will not cut off every man of yours from My altar, so that your eyes will fail from weeping and your soul grieve, and all the increase of your house will die in the prime of life.","34":"‘And this will be the sign to you which will come in regard to your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas: on the same day both of them will die.","35":"‘But I will raise up for Myself a faithful priest who will do according to what is in My heart and My soul; and I will build him an enduring house, and he will walk before My anointed always.","36":"‘And everyone who is left in your house will come to bow down to him for a silver coin or a loaf of bread and say, “Please assign me to one of the priest’s offices so that I may eat a piece of bread.”’”"},"3":{"1":"Now the boy Samuel was attending to the service of the LORD before Eli. And word from the LORD was rare in those days; visions were infrequent.","2":"But it happened at that time as Eli was lying down in his place (now his eyesight had begun to be poor and he could not see well),","3":"and the lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the temple of the LORD where the ark of God was,","4":"that the LORD called Samuel; and he said, “Here I am.”","5":"Then he ran to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” But he said, “I did not call, go back and lie down.” So he went and lay down.","6":"And the LORD called yet again, “Samuel!” So Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” But he said, “I did not call, my son, go back and lie down.”","7":"Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, nor had the word of the LORD yet been revealed to him.","8":"So the LORD called Samuel again for the third time. And he got up and went to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” Then Eli realized that the LORD was calling the boy.","9":"And Eli said to Samuel, “Go lie down, and it shall be if He calls you, that you shall say, ‘Speak, LORD, for Your servant is listening.’” So Samuel went and lay down in his place.","10":"Then the LORD came and stood, and called as at the other times: “Samuel! Samuel!” And Samuel said, “Speak, for Your servant is listening.”","11":"Then the LORD said to Samuel, “Behold, I am going to do a thing in Israel, and both ears of everyone who hears about it will ring.","12":"“On that day I will carry out against Eli everything that I have spoken in regard to his house, from beginning to end.","13":"“For I have told him that I am going to judge his house forever for the wrongdoing that he knew, because his sons were bringing a curse on themselves and he did not rebuke them.","14":"“Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the wrongdoing of Eli’s house shall never be atoned for by sacrifice or offering.”","15":"So Samuel lay down until morning. Then he opened the doors of the house of the LORD. But Samuel was afraid to tell the vision to Eli.","16":"Then Eli called Samuel and said, “Samuel, my son.” And he said, “Here I am.”","17":"He said, “What is the word that He spoke to you? Please do not hide it from me. May God do the same to you, and more so, if you hide a single word from me of all the words that He spoke to you!”","18":"So Samuel told him everything and hid nothing from him. And he said, “He is the LORD; let Him do what seems good to Him.”","19":"Now Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and He let none of his words fail.","20":"And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was confirmed as a prophet of the LORD.","21":"And the LORD appeared again at Shiloh, because the LORD revealed Himself to Samuel at Shiloh by the word of the LORD."},"4":{"1":"So the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out to meet the Philistines in battle, and they camped beside Ebenezer, while the Philistines camped in Aphek.","2":"Then the Philistines drew up in battle formation to meet Israel. When the battle spread, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand men on the battlefield.","3":"When the people came into the camp, the elders of Israel said, “Why has the LORD defeated us today before the Philistines? Let’s take the ark of the covenant of the LORD from Shiloh, so that He may come among us and save us from the power of our enemies.”","4":"So the people sent men to Shiloh, and from there they carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD of armies who is enthroned above the cherubim; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.","5":"And as the ark of the covenant of the LORD was coming into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth resounded.","6":"And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, “What does the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews mean?” Then they understood that the ark of the LORD had come into the camp.","7":"So the Philistines were afraid, for they said, “God has come into the camp!” And they said, “Woe to us! For nothing like this has happened before.","8":"“Woe to us! Who will save us from the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods who struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness.","9":"“Take courage and be men, Philistines, or you will become slaves to the Hebrews, as they have been slaves to you; so be men and fight!”","10":"So the Philistines fought and Israel was defeated, and every man fled to his tent; and the defeat was very great, for thirty thousand foot soldiers of Israel fell.","11":"Moreover, the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, died.","12":"Now a man of Benjamin ran from the battle line and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes torn, and dust on his head.","13":"When he came, behold, Eli was sitting on his seat by the road keeping watch, because his heart was anxious about the ark of God. And the man came to give a report in the city, and all the city cried out.","14":"When Eli heard the noise of the outcry, he said, “What does the noise of this commotion mean?” Then the man came hurriedly and told Eli.","15":"Now Eli was ninety-eight years old, and his eyes were fixed and he could not see.","16":"The man said to Eli, “I am the one who came from the battle line. Indeed, I escaped from the battle line today.” And he said, “How are things, my son?”","17":"Then the one who brought the news replied, “Israel has fled before the Philistines and there has also been a great defeat among the people, and your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas are also dead; and the ark of God has been taken.”","18":"When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell off the seat backward beside the gate, and his neck was broken and he died, for he was old and heavy. And so he judged Israel for forty years.","19":"Now his daughter-in-law, Phinehas’ wife, was pregnant and about to give birth; and when she heard the news that the ark of God had been taken and that her father-in-law and her husband had died, she kneeled down and gave birth, because her pains came upon her.","20":"And about the time of her death the women who were standing by her said to her, “Do not be afraid, for you have given birth to a son.” But she did not answer or pay attention.","21":"And she named the boy Ichabod, saying, “The glory has departed from Israel,” because the ark of God had been taken and because of her father-in-law and her husband.","22":"So she said, “The glory has departed from Israel, because the ark of God has been taken.”"},"5":{"1":"Now the Philistines took the ark of God and brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.","2":"Then the Philistines took the ark of God and brought it into the house of Dagon, and placed it beside Dagon.","3":"When the Ashdodites got up early the next day, behold, Dagon had fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD. So they took Dagon and set him back in his place.","4":"But when they got up early the next morning, behold, Dagon had fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD. And the head of Dagon and both palms of his hands were cut off on the threshold; only the torso of Dagon was left.","5":"For that reason neither the priests of Dagon nor any who enter Dagon’s house step on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day.","6":"Now the hand of the LORD was heavy on the Ashdodites, and He made them feel devastated and struck them with tumors, both Ashdod and its territories.","7":"When the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, “The ark of the God of Israel must not remain with us, because His hand is severe on us and on Dagon our god.”","8":"So they sent word and gathered all the governors of the Philistines to them, and said, “What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?” And they said, “Have the ark of the God of Israel brought to Gath.” So they took the ark of the God of Israel away.","9":"After they had taken it away, the hand of the LORD was against the city, creating a very great panic; and He struck the people of the city, from the young to the old, so that tumors broke out on them.","10":"So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And as the ark of God came to Ekron, the Ekronites cried out, saying, “They have brought the ark of the God of Israel to us, to kill us and our people!”","11":"Therefore they sent word and gathered all the governors of the Philistines, and said, “Send away the ark of the God of Israel and let it return to its own place, so that it will not kill us and our people!” For there was a deadly panic throughout the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.","12":"And the people who did not die were struck with tumors, and the outcry of the city went up to heaven."},"6":{"1":"Now the ark of the LORD had been in the territory of the Philistines for seven months.","2":"And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, “What are we to do with the ark of the LORD? Tell us how we may send it to its place.”","3":"And they said, “If you are going to send the ark of the God of Israel away, do not send it empty; but you shall certainly return to Him a guilt offering. Then you will be healed, and it will be revealed to you why His hand does not leave you.”","4":"Then they said, “What is to be the guilt offering that we shall return to Him?” And they said, “Five gold tumors and five gold mice corresponding to the number of the governors of the Philistines, since one plague was on all of you and on your governors.","5":"“So you shall make likenesses of your tumors and likenesses of your mice that are ruining the land, and you shall give glory to the God of Israel; perhaps He will lighten His hand from you, your gods, and your land.","6":"“Why then do you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When He had severely dealt with them, did they not let the people go, and they left?","7":"“Now then, take and prepare a new cart and two milk cows on which there has never been a yoke; and hitch the cows to the cart and take their calves back home, away from them.","8":"“Then take the ark of the LORD and place it on the cart; and put the articles of gold which you return to Him as a guilt offering in a saddlebag by its side. Then send it away that it may go.","9":"“But watch: if it goes up by the way of its own territory to Beth-shemesh, then He has done this great evil to us. But if not, then we will know that it was not His hand that struck us; it happened to us by chance.”","10":"Then the men did so: they took two milk cows and hitched them to the cart, and shut in their calves at home.","11":"And they put the ark of the LORD on the cart, and the saddlebag with the gold mice and the likenesses of their tumors.","12":"Now the cows went straight in the direction of Beth-shemesh; they went on the same road, bellowing as they went, and did not turn off to the right or to the left. And the governors of the Philistines followed them to the border of Beth-shemesh.","13":"Now the people of Beth-shemesh were gathering in their wheat harvest in the valley, and they raised their eyes and saw the ark, and rejoiced at seeing it.","14":"And the cart came into the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite and stopped there where there was a large stone; and they split the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the LORD.","15":"And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD and the saddlebag that was with it, in which were the articles of gold, and put them on the large stone; and the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices that day to the LORD.","16":"When the five governors of the Philistines saw it, they returned to Ekron that day.","17":"Now these are the gold tumors which the Philistines returned as a guilt offering to the LORD: one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, and one for Ekron;","18":"and the gold mice, corresponding to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five governors, both of fortified cities and of country villages. The large stone on which they placed the ark of the LORD is a witness to this day in the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite.","19":"Now He fatally struck some of the men of Beth-shemesh because they had looked into the ark of the LORD. He struck 50,070 men among the people, and the people mourned because the LORD had struck the people with a great slaughter.","20":"And the men of Beth-shemesh said, “Who is able to stand before the LORD, this holy God? And to whom will He go up from us?”","21":"So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim, saying, “The Philistines have brought back the ark of the LORD; come down and take it up to yourselves.”"},"7":{"1":"And the men of Kiriath-jearim came and took the ark of the LORD and brought it into the house of Abinadab on the hill, and they consecrated his son Eleazar to watch over the ark of the LORD.","2":"From the day that the ark remained at Kiriath-jearim, the time was long, for it was twenty years; and all the house of Israel mourned after the LORD.","3":"Then Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, “If you are returning to the LORD with all your heart, then remove the foreign gods and the Ashtaroth from among you, and direct your hearts to the LORD and serve Him alone; and He will save you from the hand of the Philistines.”","4":"So the sons of Israel removed the Baals and the Ashtaroth, and served the LORD alone.","5":"Then Samuel said, “Gather all Israel to Mizpah and I will pray to the LORD for you.”","6":"So they gathered to Mizpah, and drew water and poured it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day and said there, “We have sinned against the LORD.” And Samuel judged the sons of Israel at Mizpah.","7":"Now when the Philistines heard that the sons of Israel had gathered at Mizpah, the governors of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the sons of Israel heard about it, they were afraid of the Philistines.","8":"So the sons of Israel said to Samuel, “Do not stop crying out to the LORD our God for us, that He will save us from the hand of the Philistines!”","9":"Samuel took a nursing lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the LORD; and Samuel cried out to the LORD for Israel, and the LORD answered him.","10":"Now Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, and the Philistines advanced to battle Israel. But the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day against the Philistines and confused them, so that they were struck down before Israel.","11":"And the men of Israel came out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, and killed them as far as below Beth-car.","12":"Then Samuel took a stone and placed it between Mizpah and Shen, and named it Ebenezer, saying, “So far the LORD has helped us.”","13":"So the Philistines were subdued, and they did not come anymore within the border of Israel. And the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.","14":"The cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even to Gath; and Israel recovered their territory from the hand of the Philistines. So there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.","15":"Now Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.","16":"And he used to go annually on a circuit to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah, and he judged Israel in all these places.","17":"Then he would make his return to Ramah, because his house was there, and there he also judged Israel; and there he built an altar to the LORD."},"8":{"1":"Now it came about, when Samuel was old, that he appointed his sons as judges over Israel.","2":"The name of his firstborn was Joel, and the name of his second, Abijah; they were judging in Beersheba.","3":"His sons, however, did not walk in his ways but turned aside after dishonest gain, and they took bribes and perverted justice.","4":"Then all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah;","5":"and they said to him, “Behold, you have grown old, and your sons do not walk in your ways. Now appoint us a king to judge us like all the nations.”","6":"But the matter was displeasing in the sight of Samuel when they said, “Give us a king to judge us.” And Samuel prayed to the LORD.","7":"And the LORD said to Samuel, “Listen to the voice of the people regarding all that they say to you, because they have not rejected you, but they have rejected Me from being King over them.","8":"“Like all the deeds which they have done since the day that I brought them up from Egypt even to this day—in that they have abandoned Me and served other gods—so they are doing to you as well.","9":"“Now then, listen to their voice; however, you shall warn them strongly and tell them of the practice of the king who will reign over them.”","10":"So Samuel spoke all the words of the LORD to the people who had asked him for a king.","11":"And he said, “This will be the practice of the king who will reign over you: he will take your sons and put them in his chariots for himself and among his horsemen, and they will run before his chariots.","12":"“He will appoint for himself commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and some to do his plowing and to gather in his harvest, and to make his weapons of war and equipment for his chariots.","13":"“He will also take your daughters and use them as perfumers, cooks, and bakers.","14":"“He will take the best of your fields, your vineyards, and your olive groves, and give them to his servants.","15":"“And he will take a tenth of your seed and your vineyards and give it to his high officials and his servants.","16":"“He will also take your male servants and your female servants, and your best young men, and your donkeys, and use them for his work.","17":"“He will take a tenth of your flocks, and you yourselves will become his servants.","18":"“Then you will cry out on that day because of your king whom you have chosen for yourselves, but the LORD will not answer you on that day.”","19":"Yet the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel, and they said, “No, but there shall be a king over us,","20":"so that we also may be like all the nations, and our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles.”","21":"Now after Samuel had heard all the words of the people, he repeated them in the LORD’S hearing.","22":"And the LORD said to Samuel, “Listen to their voice and appoint a king for them.” So Samuel said to the men of Israel, “Go, every man to his city.”"},"9":{"1":"Now there was a man of Benjamin whose name was Kish the son of Abiel, son of Zeror, son of Becorath, son of Aphiah, son of a Benjaminite, a valiant mighty man.","2":"He had a son whose name was Saul, a young and handsome man, and there was not a more handsome man than he among the sons of Israel; from his shoulders and up he was taller than any of the people.","3":"Now the donkeys of Kish, Saul’s father, had wandered off. So Kish said to his son Saul, “Now take with you one of the servants and arise, go search for the donkeys.”","4":"So he passed through the hill country of Ephraim and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they did not find them. Then they passed through the land of Shaalim, but they were not there. Then he passed through the land of the Benjaminites, but they did not find them.","5":"When they came to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, “Come, and let’s return, or else my father will stop being concerned about the donkeys and will become anxious about us.”","6":"But he said to him, “Behold now, there is a man of God in this city, and the man is held in honor; everything that he says definitely comes true. Now let’s go there, perhaps he can tell us about our journey on which we have set out.”","7":"Then Saul said to his servant, “But look, if we go, what shall we bring the man? For the bread is gone from our sacks and there is no gift to bring to the man of God. What do we have?”","8":"The servant answered Saul again and said, “Look, I have in my hand a fourth of a shekel of silver; I will give it to the man of God and he will tell us our way.”","9":"(Previously in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, he used to say, “Come, and let’s go to the seer”; for he who is called a prophet now was previously called a seer.)","10":"Then Saul said to his servant, “Good idea; come, let’s go.” So they went to the city where the man of God was.","11":"As they went up the slope to the city, they found young women going out to draw water, and they said to them, “Is the seer here?”","12":"They answered them and said, “He is; see, he is ahead of you. Hurry now, for he has come into the city today, because the people have a sacrifice on the high place today.","13":"“As soon as you enter the city you will find him before he goes up to the high place to eat, for the people will not eat until he comes, because he must bless the sacrifice; afterward those who are invited will eat. Now then, go up, for you will find him about this time.”","14":"So they went up to the city. As they came into the city, behold, Samuel was coming out toward them to go up to the high place.","15":"Now a day before Saul’s coming, the LORD had revealed this to Samuel, saying,","16":"“About this time tomorrow I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him as ruler over My people Israel; and he will save My people from the hand of the Philistines. For I have considered My people, because their outcry has come to Me.”","17":"When Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said to him, “Behold, the man of whom I spoke to you! This one shall rule over My people.”","18":"Then Saul approached Samuel at the gateway and said, “Please tell me where the seer’s house is.”","19":"And Samuel answered Saul and said, “I am the seer. Go up ahead of me to the high place, for you shall eat with me today; and in the morning I will let you go, and will tell you everything that is on your mind.","20":"“And as for your donkeys that wandered off three days ago, do not be concerned about them, for they have been found. And for whom is everything that is desirable in Israel? Is it not for you and for all your father’s household?”","21":"Saul replied, “Am I not a Benjaminite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel, and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then have you spoken to me in this way?”","22":"Then Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them into the hall, and gave them a place at the head of those who were invited, who were about thirty men.","23":"And Samuel said to the cook, “Serve the portion that I gave you about which I said to you, ‘Set it aside.’”","24":"Then the cook took up the leg with what was on it and placed it before Saul. And Samuel said, “Here is what has been reserved! Place it before you and eat, because it has been kept for you until the appointed time, since I said I have invited the people.” So Saul ate with Samuel that day.","25":"When they came down from the high place into the city, Samuel spoke with Saul on the roof.","26":"And they got up early; and at daybreak Samuel called to Saul on the roof, saying, “Get up, so that I may send you on your way.” So Saul got up, and both he and Samuel went out into the street.","27":"As they were going down to the edge of the city, Samuel said to Saul, “Speak to the servant and have him go on ahead of us and pass by; but you stand here now, so that I may proclaim the word of God to you.”"},"10":{"1":"Then Samuel took the flask of oil, poured it on Saul’s head, kissed him, and said, “Has the LORD not anointed you as ruler over His inheritance?","2":"“When you leave me today, then you will find two men close to Rachel’s tomb in the territory of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say to you, ‘The donkeys which you went to look for have been found. Now behold, your father has stopped talking about the donkeys and is anxious about you, saying, “What am I to do about my son?”’","3":"“Then you will go on farther from there, and you will come as far as the oak of Tabor, and there three men going up to God at Bethel will meet you: one carrying three young goats, another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a jug of wine.","4":"And they will greet you and give you two loaves of bread, which you will accept from their hand.","5":"“Afterward you will come to the hill of God where the Philistine garrison is; and it shall be as soon as you have come there to the city, that you will meet a group of prophets coming down from the high place with harp, tambourine, flute, and a lyre in front of them, and they will be prophesying.","6":"“Then the Spirit of the LORD will rush upon you, and you will prophesy with them and be changed into a different man.","7":"“And it shall be when these signs come to you, do for yourself what the occasion requires, because God is with you.","8":"“And you shall go down ahead of me to Gilgal; and behold, I will be coming down to you to offer burnt offerings and sacrifice peace offerings. You shall wait seven days until I come to you and inform you of what you should do.”","9":"Then it happened, when he turned his back to leave Samuel, that God changed his heart; and all those signs came about on that day.","10":"When they came there to the hill, behold, a group of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God rushed upon him, so that he prophesied among them.","11":"And it came about, when all who previously knew him saw that he was indeed prophesying with the prophets, that the people said to one another, “What is this that has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?”","12":"And a man from there responded and said, “And who is their father?” Therefore it became a saying: “Is Saul also among the prophets?”","13":"When he had finished prophesying, he came to the high place.","14":"Now Saul’s uncle said to him and his servant, “Where did you go?” And he said, “To look for the donkeys. When we saw that they were nowhere to be found, we went to Samuel.”","15":"Saul’s uncle said, “Please tell me what Samuel said to you.”","16":"So Saul said to his uncle, “He told us plainly that the donkeys had been found.” But he did not tell him about the matter of the kingdom which Samuel had mentioned.","17":"Now Samuel called the people together to the LORD at Mizpah;","18":"and he said to the sons of Israel, “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel says: ‘I brought Israel up from Egypt, and I rescued you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the power of all the kingdoms that were oppressing you.’","19":"“But today you have rejected your God, who saves you from all your catastrophes and your distresses; yet you have said, ‘No, but put a king over us!’ Now then, present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes and by your groups of thousands.”","20":"So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel forward; and the tribe of Benjamin was selected by lot.","21":"Then he brought the tribe of Benjamin forward by its families, and the Matrite family was selected by lot. And Saul the son of Kish was selected by lot; but when they looked for him, he could not be found.","22":"Therefore they inquired further of the LORD: “Has the man come here yet?” And the LORD said, “Behold, he is hiding himself among the baggage.”","23":"So they ran and took him from there, and when he stood among the people, he was taller than any of the people from his shoulders upward.","24":"Samuel said to all the people, “Do you see him whom the LORD has chosen? Surely there is no one like him among all the people.” So all the people shouted and said, “Long live the king!”","25":"Then Samuel told the people the ordinances of the kingdom, and wrote them in the book, and placed it before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the people away, each one to his house.","26":"Saul also went to his house in Gibeah; and the valiant men whose hearts God had touched went with him.","27":"But certain useless men said, “How can this one save us?” And they despised him and did not bring him a gift. But he kept silent about it."},"11":{"1":"Now Nahash the Ammonite went up and besieged Jabesh-gilead; and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, “Make a covenant with us and we will serve you.”","2":"But Nahash the Ammonite said to them, “I will make it with you on this condition, that I will gouge out the right eye of every one of you, and thereby I will inflict a disgrace on all Israel.”","3":"So the elders of Jabesh said to him, “Allow us seven days to send messengers throughout the territory of Israel. Then, if there is no one to save us, we will come out to you.”","4":"Then the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and spoke these words in the hearing of the people, and all the people raised their voices and wept.","5":"Now behold, Saul was coming from the field behind the oxen, and Saul said, “What is the matter with the people that they weep?” So they reported to him the words of the men of Jabesh.","6":"Then the Spirit of God rushed upon Saul when he heard these words, and he became very angry.","7":"He then took a yoke of oxen and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout the territory of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, “Whoever does not come out after Saul and after Samuel, the same shall be done to his oxen.” Then the dread of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out as one person.","8":"He counted them in Bezek; and the sons of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah, thirty thousand.","9":"They said to the messengers who had come, “This is what you shall say to the men of Jabesh-gilead: ‘Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, you will be saved.’” So the messengers went and told the men of Jabesh; and they rejoiced.","10":"Then the men of Jabesh said, “Tomorrow we will come out to you, and you may do to us whatever seems good to you.”","11":"The next morning Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the camp at the morning watch, and struck and killed the Ammonites until the heat of the day. And those who survived scattered, so that no two of them were left together.","12":"Then the people said to Samuel, “Who is he that said, ‘Shall Saul reign over us?’ Bring the men, so that we may put them to death!”","13":"But Saul said, “Not a single person shall be put to death this day, for today the LORD has brought about victory in Israel.”","14":"Then Samuel said to the people, “Come, and let us go to Gilgal and renew the kingdom there.”","15":"So all the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal. There they also offered sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly."},"12":{"1":"Then Samuel said to all Israel, “Behold, I have listened to your voice for all that you said to me, and I have appointed a king over you.","2":"“Now, here is the king walking before you, but as for me, I am old and gray, and my sons are here with you. And I have walked before you since my youth to this day.","3":"“Here I am; testify against me before the LORD and His anointed. Whose ox have I taken, or whose donkey have I taken, or whom have I exploited? Whom have I oppressed, or from whose hand have I taken a bribe to close my eyes with it? I will return it to you.”","4":"And they said, “You have not exploited us or oppressed us, or taken anything from anyone’s hand.”","5":"So he said to them, “The LORD is witness against you, and His anointed is witness this day that you have found nothing in my hand.” And they said, “He is witness.”","6":"Then Samuel said to the people, “It is the LORD who appointed Moses and Aaron and who brought your fathers up from the land of Egypt.","7":"“Now then, take your stand, so that I may enter into judgment with you before the LORD concerning all the righteous acts of the LORD that He did for you and your fathers.","8":"“When Jacob went into Egypt and your fathers cried out to the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron who brought your fathers out of Egypt and settled them in this place.","9":"“But they forgot the LORD their God, so He sold them into the hand of Sisera, commander of the army of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them.","10":"“They cried out to the LORD and said, ‘We have sinned, because we have abandoned the LORD and have served the Baals and the Ashtaroth; but now save us from the hands of our enemies, and we will serve You.’","11":"“Then the LORD sent Jerubbaal, Bedan, Jephthah, and Samuel, and saved you from the hands of your enemies all around, so that you lived in security.","12":"“But when you saw that Nahash the king of the sons of Ammon was coming against you, you said to me, ‘No, but a king shall reign over us!’ Yet the LORD your God was your king.","13":"“And now, behold, the king whom you have chosen, whom you have asked for, and behold, the LORD has put a king over you.","14":"“If you will fear the LORD and serve Him, and listen to His voice and not rebel against the command of the LORD, then both you and the king who reigns over you will follow the LORD your God.","15":"“But if you do not listen to the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the command of the LORD, then the hand of the LORD will be against you, even as it was against your fathers.","16":"“Even now, take your stand and see this great thing which the LORD is going to do before your eyes.","17":"“Is it not the wheat harvest today? I will call to the LORD, that He will send thunder and rain. Then you will know and see that your wickedness is great which you have done in the sight of the LORD, by asking for yourselves a king.”","18":"So Samuel called to the LORD, and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day; and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel.","19":"Then all the people said to Samuel, “Pray to the LORD your God for your servants, so that we do not die; for we have added to all our sins this evil, by asking for ourselves a king.”","20":"Samuel said to the people, “Do not fear. You have committed all this evil, yet do not turn aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart.","21":"“Indeed, you must not turn aside, for then you would go after useless things which cannot benefit or save, because they are useless.","22":"“For the LORD will not abandon His people on account of His great name, because the LORD has been pleased to make you a people for Himself.","23":"“Furthermore, as for me, far be it from me that I would sin against the LORD by ceasing to pray for you; but I will instruct you in the good and right way.","24":"“Only fear the LORD and serve Him in truth with all your heart; for consider what great things He has done for you.","25":"“But if you still do evil, both you and your king will be swept away.”"},"13":{"1":"Saul was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for forty-two years over Israel.","2":"Now Saul chose for himself three thousand men of Israel, of whom two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in the hill country of Bethel, while a thousand were with Jonathan at Gibeah of Benjamin. But he sent the rest of the people away, each to his tent.","3":"And Jonathan attacked the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard about it. Then Saul blew the trumpet throughout the land, saying, “Let the Hebrews hear!”","4":"And all Israel heard the news that Saul had attacked the garrison of the Philistines, and also that Israel had become repulsive to the Philistines. Then the people were summoned to Saul at Gilgal.","5":"Now the Philistines assembled to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen, and people like the sand which is on the seashore in abundance; and they came up and camped in Michmash, east of Beth-aven.","6":"When the men of Israel saw that they were in trouble (for the people were hard-pressed), then the people kept themselves hidden in caves, in crevices, in cliffs, in crypts, and in pits.","7":"And some of the Hebrews crossed the Jordan into the land of Gad and Gilead. But as for Saul, he was still in Gilgal, and all the people followed him, trembling.","8":"Now he waited for seven days, until the appointed time that Samuel had set, but Samuel did not come to Gilgal; and the people were scattering from him.","9":"So Saul said, “Bring me the burnt offering and the peace offerings.” And he offered the burnt offering.","10":"But as soon as he finished offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him and to greet him.","11":"But Samuel said, “What have you done?” And Saul said, “Since I saw that the people were scattering from me, and that you did not come at the appointed time, and that the Philistines were assembling at Michmash,","12":"I thought, ‘Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not asked the favor of the LORD.’ So I worked up the courage and offered the burnt offering.”","13":"But Samuel said to Saul, “You have acted foolishly! You have not kept the commandment of the LORD your God, which He commanded you, for the LORD would now have established your kingdom over Israel forever.","14":"“But now your kingdom shall not endure. The LORD has sought for Himself a man after His own heart, and the LORD has appointed him ruler over His people, because you have not kept what the LORD commanded you.”","15":"Then Samuel set out and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul counted the people who were present with him, about six hundred men.","16":"Now Saul, his son Jonathan, and the people who were present with them were staying in Geba of Benjamin while the Philistines camped at Michmash.","17":"Then raiders came from the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned toward Ophrah, to the land of Shual,","18":"and another company turned toward Beth-horon, and another company turned toward the border that overlooks the Valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.","19":"Now no blacksmith could be found in all the land of Israel, because the Philistines said, “Otherwise the Hebrews will make swords or spears.”","20":"So all Israel went down to the Philistines, each to sharpen his plowshare, his mattock, his axe, and his hoe.","21":"The charge was two-thirds of a shekel for the plowshares, the mattocks, the forks, and the axes, and to fix the cattle goads.","22":"So it came about on the day of battle that neither sword nor spear was found in the hands of any of the people who were with Saul and Jonathan, but they were found with Saul and his son Jonathan.","23":"And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the gorge of Michmash."},"14":{"1":"Now the day came that Jonathan, the son of Saul, said to the young man who was carrying his armor, “Come, and let’s cross over to the Philistines’ garrison that is on the other side.” But he did not tell his father.","2":"Saul was staying on the outskirts of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree that is in Migron. And the people who were with him numbered about six hundred men;","3":"and Ahijah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod’s brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the priest of the LORD at Shiloh, was wearing an ephod. And the people did not know that Jonathan had gone.","4":"Now between the gorges by which Jonathan sought to cross over to the Philistines’ garrison there was a rocky crag on the one side, and a rocky crag on the other side; and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other, Seneh.","5":"The one crag rose on the north opposite Michmash, and the other on the south opposite Geba.","6":"Then Jonathan said to the young man who was carrying his armor, “Come, and let’s cross over to the garrison of these uncircumcised men; perhaps the LORD will work for us, because the LORD is not limited to saving by many or by few!”","7":"His armor bearer said to him, “Do everything that is in your heart; turn yourself to it, and here I am with you, as your heart desires.”","8":"Then Jonathan said, “Behold, we are going to cross over to the men and reveal ourselves to them.","9":"“If they say to us, ‘Wait until we come to you’; then we will stand in our place and not go up to them.","10":"“But if they say, ‘Come up to us,’ then we will go up, for the LORD has handed them over to us; and this shall be the sign to us.”","11":"When the two of them revealed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines, the Philistines said, “Behold, Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have kept themselves hidden.”","12":"So the men of the garrison responded to Jonathan and his armor bearer and said, “Come up to us and we will inform you of something.” And Jonathan said to his armor bearer, “Come up after me, for the LORD has handed them over to Israel.”","13":"Then Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet, with his armor bearer behind him; and the men fell before Jonathan, and his armor bearer put some to death after him.","14":"Now that first slaughter which Jonathan and his armor bearer inflicted was about twenty men within about half a furrow in an acre of land.","15":"And there was a trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people. Even the garrison and the raiders trembled, and the earth quaked so that it became a great trembling.","16":"Now Saul’s watchmen in Gibeah of Benjamin looked, and behold, the multitude dissolved; they went here and there.","17":"So Saul said to the people who were with him, “Look carefully now and see who has left us.” And when they had looked, behold, Jonathan and his armor bearer were not there.","18":"Then Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring the ark of God here.” For at that time the ark of God was with the sons of Israel.","19":"While Saul talked to the priest, the commotion in the camp of the Philistines continued and increased; so Saul said to the priest, “Withdraw your hand.”","20":"Then Saul and all the people who were with him rallied and came to the battle; and behold, every man’s sword was against his fellow Philistine, and there was very great confusion.","21":"Now the Hebrews who were with the Philistines previously, who went up with them all around in the camp, even they also returned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.","22":"When all the men of Israel who had kept themselves hidden in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines had fled, they also closely pursued them in the battle.","23":"So the LORD saved Israel that day, and the battle spread beyond Beth-aven.","24":"Now the men of Israel were hard-pressed on that day, for Saul had put the people under oath, saying, “Cursed be the man who eats food before evening, and before I have avenged myself on my enemies.” So none of the people tasted food.","25":"All the people of the land entered the forest, and there was honey on the ground.","26":"When the people entered the forest, behold, there was honey dripping; but no man put his hand to his mouth, because the people feared the oath.","27":"However, Jonathan had not heard it when his father put the people under oath; so he put out the end of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth, and his eyes brightened.","28":"Then one of the people responded and said, “Your father strictly put the people under oath, saying, ‘Cursed be the man who eats food today.’” And the people were weary.","29":"Then Jonathan said, “My father has troubled the land. See now that my eyes have brightened because I tasted a little of this honey.","30":"“How much more, if only the people had freely eaten today of the spoils of their enemies which they found! For now the defeat among the Philistines has not been great.”","31":"They attacked the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. But the people were very tired.","32":"So the people loudly rushed upon the spoils, and took sheep, oxen, and calves, and slaughtered them on the ground; and the people ate them with the blood.","33":"Then observers informed Saul, saying, “Look, the people are sinning against the LORD by eating meat with the blood.” And he said, “You have acted treacherously; roll a large rock to me today.”","34":"Then Saul said, “Disperse yourselves among the people and say to them, ‘Each one of you bring me his ox or his sheep, and slaughter it here and eat; and do not sin against the LORD by eating it with the blood.’” So all the people brought them that night, each one his ox with him, and they slaughtered them there.","35":"And Saul built an altar to the LORD; it was the first altar that he built to the LORD.","36":"Then Saul said, “Let’s go down after the Philistines by night and take plunder among them until the morning light, and let’s not leave a man among them alive.” And they said, “Do whatever seems good to you.” So the priest said, “Let’s approach God here.”","37":"So Saul inquired of God: “Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will You hand them over to Israel?” But He did not answer him on that day.","38":"Then Saul said, “Come here, all you leaders of the people, and investigate and see how this sin has happened today.","39":"“For as the LORD lives, who saves Israel, even if it is in my son Jonathan, he shall assuredly die!” But not one of all the people answered him.","40":"Then he said to all Israel, “You shall be on one side, and I and my son Jonathan will be on the other side.” And the people said to Saul, “Do what seems good to you.”","41":"Therefore, Saul said to the LORD, the God of Israel, “Give a perfect lot.” And Jonathan and Saul were selected by lot, but the people were exonerated.","42":"Then Saul said, “Cast lots between me and my son Jonathan.” And Jonathan was selected by lot.","43":"So Saul said to Jonathan, “Tell me what you have done.” And Jonathan told him, and said, “I did indeed taste a little honey with the end of the staff that was in my hand. Here I am, I must die!”","44":"And Saul said, “May God do the same to me and more also, for you shall certainly die, Jonathan!”","45":"But the people said to Saul, “Must Jonathan die, he who has brought about this great victory in Israel? Far from it! As the LORD lives, not even a hair of his head shall fall to the ground, because he has worked with God this day.” So the people rescued Jonathan and he did not die.","46":"Then Saul went up from pursuing the Philistines, and the Philistines went to their own place.","47":"Now when Saul had taken control of the kingdom over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, the sons of Ammon, Edom, the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines; and wherever he turned, he inflicted punishment.","48":"And he acted valiantly and defeated the Amalekites, and saved Israel from the hands of those who plundered them.","49":"Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malchi-shua; and the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the firstborn was Merab, and the name of the younger, Michal.","50":"And the name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. And the name of the commander of his army was Abner the son of Ner, Saul’s uncle.","51":"Kish was the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.","52":"Now the war against the Philistines was severe all the days of Saul; and when Saul saw any warrior or any valiant man, he attached him to his staff."},"15":{"1":"Then Samuel said to Saul, “The LORD sent me to anoint you as king over His people, over Israel; now therefore, listen to the words of the LORD.","2":"“This is what the LORD of armies says: ‘I will punish Amalek for what he did to Israel, in that he obstructed him on the way while he was coming up from Egypt.","3":"‘Now go and strike Amalek and completely destroy everything that he has, and do not spare him; but put to death both man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.’”","4":"Then Saul summoned the people and counted them in Telaim: two hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand men of Judah.","5":"And Saul came to the city of Amalek and set an ambush in the wadi.","6":"But Saul said to the Kenites, “Go, get away, go down from among the Amalekites, so that I do not destroy you along with them; for you showed kindness to all the sons of Israel when they went up from Egypt.” So the Kenites got away from among the Amalekites.","7":"Then Saul defeated the Amalekites, from Havilah going toward Shur, which is east of Egypt.","8":"He captured Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and completely destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.","9":"But Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the sheep, the oxen, the more valuable animals, the lambs, and everything that was good, and were unwilling to destroy them completely; but everything despicable and weak, that they completely destroyed.","10":"Then the word of the LORD came to Samuel, saying,","11":"“I regret that I have made Saul king, because he has turned back from following Me and has not carried out My commands.” And Samuel was furious and cried out to the LORD all night.","12":"Samuel got up early in the morning to meet Saul; and it was reported to Samuel, saying, “Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he set up a monument for himself, then turned and proceeded on down to Gilgal.”","13":"So Samuel came to Saul, and Saul said to him, “Blessed are you of the LORD! I have carried out the command of the LORD.”","14":"But Samuel said, “What then is this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the bellowing of the oxen which I hear?”","15":"Saul said, “They have brought them from the Amalekites, for the people spared the best of the sheep and oxen to sacrifice to the LORD your God; but the rest we have completely destroyed.”","16":"Then Samuel said to Saul, “Stop, and let me inform you of what the LORD said to me last night.” And he said to him, “Speak!”","17":"So Samuel said, “Is it not true, though you were insignificant in your own eyes, that you became the head of the tribes of Israel? For the LORD anointed you as king over Israel.","18":"“And the LORD sent you on a mission, and said, ‘Go and completely destroy the sinners, the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are eliminated.’","19":"“Why then did you not obey the voice of the LORD? Instead, you loudly rushed upon the spoils and did what was evil in the sight of the LORD!”","20":"Then Saul said to Samuel, “I did obey the voice of the LORD, for I went on the mission on which the LORD sent me; and I have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have completely destroyed the Amalekites.","21":"“But the people took some of the spoils, sheep and oxen, the choicest of the things designated for destruction, to sacrifice to the LORD your God at Gilgal.”","22":"Samuel said,\n“Does the LORD have as much delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices\nAs in obeying the voice of the LORD?\nBehold, to obey is better than a sacrifice,\nAnd to pay attention is better than the fat of rams.","23":"“For rebellion is as reprehensible as the sin of divination,\nAnd insubordination is as reprehensible as false religion and idolatry.\nSince you have rejected the word of the LORD,\nHe has also rejected you from being king.”","24":"Then Saul said to Samuel, “I have sinned, for I have violated the command of the LORD and your words, because I feared the people and listened to their voice.","25":"“Now then, please pardon my sin and return with me, so that I may worship the LORD.”","26":"But Samuel said to Saul, “I will not return with you; for you have rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD has rejected you from being king over Israel.”","27":"Then Samuel turned to go, but Saul grasped the edge of his robe, and it tore off.","28":"So Samuel said to him, “The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today and has given it to your neighbor, who is better than you.","29":"“Also the Glory of Israel will not lie nor change His mind; for He is not a man, that He would change His mind.”","30":"Then Saul said, “I have sinned; but please honor me now before the elders of my people and before all Israel, and go back with me, so that I may worship the LORD your God.”","31":"So Samuel went back following Saul, and Saul worshiped the LORD.","32":"Then Samuel said, “Bring me Agag, the king of the Amalekites.” And Agag came to him cheerfully. And Agag said, “Surely the bitterness of death is gone!”","33":"But Samuel said, “As your sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women.” And Samuel cut Agag to pieces before the LORD at Gilgal.","34":"Then Samuel went to Ramah, but Saul went up to his house at Gibeah of Saul.","35":"And Samuel did not see Saul again until the day of his death, though Samuel mourned for Saul. And the LORD regretted that He had made Saul king over Israel."},"16":{"1":"Now the LORD said to Samuel, “How long are you going to mourn for Saul, since I have rejected him from being king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil and go; I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, because I have chosen a king for Myself among his sons.”","2":"But Samuel said, “How can I go? When Saul hears about it, he will kill me.” But the LORD said, “Take a heifer with you and say, ‘I have come to sacrifice to the LORD.’","3":"“And you shall invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will let you know what you shall do; and you shall anoint for Me the one whom I designate to you.”","4":"So Samuel did what the LORD told him, and he came to Bethlehem. Then the elders of the city came trembling to meet him and said, “Do you come in peace?”","5":"And he said, “In peace; I have come to sacrifice to the LORD. Consecrate yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice.” He also consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.","6":"When they entered, he looked at Eliab and thought, “Surely the LORD’S anointed is standing before Him.”","7":"But the LORD said to Samuel, “Do not look at his appearance or at the height of his stature, because I have rejected him; for God does not see as man sees, since man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart.”","8":"Then Jesse called Abinadab and had him pass before Samuel. But he said, “The LORD has not chosen this one, either.”","9":"Next Jesse had Shammah pass by. And he said, “The LORD has not chosen this one, either.”","10":"So Jesse had seven of his sons pass before Samuel. But Samuel said to Jesse, “The LORD has not chosen these.”","11":"Then Samuel said to Jesse, “Are these all the boys?” And he said, “The youngest is still left, but behold, he is tending the sheep.” So Samuel said to Jesse, “Send word and bring him; for we will not take our places at the table until he comes here.”","12":"So he sent word and brought him in. Now he was reddish, with beautiful eyes and a handsome appearance. And the LORD said, “Arise, anoint him; for this is he.”","13":"So Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers; and the Spirit of the LORD rushed upon David from that day forward. And Samuel set out and went to Ramah.","14":"Now the Spirit of the LORD left Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD terrified him.","15":"Saul’s servants then said to him, “Behold now, an evil spirit from God is terrifying you.","16":"“May our lord now command your servants who are before you. Have them search for a man who is a skillful musician on the harp; and it shall come about whenever the evil spirit from God is upon you, that he shall play the harp with his hand, and you will become well.”","17":"So Saul said to his servants, “Now select for me a man who can play well, and bring him to me.”","18":"Then one of the young men responded and said, “Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who is a skillful musician, a valiant mighty man, a warrior, skillful in speech, and a handsome man; and the LORD is with him.”","19":"So Saul sent messengers to Jesse to say, “Send me your son David, who is with the flock.”","20":"And Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread and a jug of wine, and he took a young goat, and sent them to Saul by his son David.","21":"Then David came to Saul and attended him; and Saul greatly loved him, and he became his armor bearer.","22":"So Saul sent word to Jesse, saying, “Let David now be my attendant for he has found favor in my sight.”","23":"So it came about whenever the evil spirit from God came to Saul, David would take the harp and play it with his hand; and Saul would feel relieved and become well, and the evil spirit would leave him."},"17":{"1":"Now the Philistines gathered their armies for battle; and they were gathered at Socoh which belongs to Judah, and they camped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.","2":"Saul and the men of Israel were assembled and camped in the Valley of Elah, and they drew up in battle formation to confront the Philistines.","3":"The Philistines were standing on the mountain on one side, while Israel was standing on the mountain on the other side, with the valley between them.","4":"Then a champion came forward from the army encampment of the Philistines, named Goliath, from Gath. His height was six cubits and a span.","5":"And he had a bronze helmet on his head, and he wore scale-armor which weighed five thousand shekels of bronze.","6":"He also had bronze greaves on his legs and a bronze saber slung between his shoulders.","7":"The shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam, and the head of his spear weighed six hundred shekels of iron; and his shield-carrier walked in front of him.","8":"He stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel and said to them, “Why do you come out to draw up in battle formation? Am I not the Philistine, and you the servants of Saul? Choose a man as your representative and have him come down to me.","9":"“If he is able to fight me and kill me, then we will become your servants; but if I prevail against him and kill him, then you shall become our servants and serve us.”","10":"Then the Philistine said, “I have defied the ranks of Israel this day! Give me a man, so that we may fight together.”","11":"When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and very fearful.","12":"Now David was the son of the Ephrathite of Bethlehem in Judah, the man whose name was Jesse, and he had eight sons. And Jesse was old in the days of Saul, advanced in years among men.","13":"The three older sons of Jesse had followed Saul to the battle. And the names of his three sons who had gone into the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and second to him, Abinadab, and the third, Shammah.","14":"So David was the youngest. Now the three oldest followed Saul,","15":"but David went back and forth from Saul to tend his father’s flock at Bethlehem.","16":"And the Philistine came forward morning and evening, and took his stand for forty days.","17":"Then Jesse said to his son David, “Take now for your brothers an ephah of this roasted grain and these ten loaves, and run to the camp to your brothers.","18":"“Bring also these ten slices of cheese to the commander of their thousand, and look into the well-being of your brothers and bring back confirmation from them.","19":"“For Saul and they and all the men of Israel are in the Valley of Elah, fighting the Philistines.”","20":"So David got up early in the morning and left the flock with a keeper, and took the supplies and went as Jesse had commanded him. And he came to the entrenchment encircling the camp while the army was going out in battle formation, shouting the war cry.","21":"Israel and the Philistines drew up in battle formation, army against army.","22":"Then David left the baggage in the care of the baggage keeper and ran to the battle line. And he entered and greeted his brothers.","23":"As he was speaking with them, behold, the champion, the Philistine from Gath named Goliath, was coming up from the army of the Philistines, and he spoke these same words; and David heard him.","24":"When all the men of Israel saw the man, they fled from him and were very fearful.","25":"And the men of Israel said, “Have you seen this man who is coming up? Surely he is coming up to defy Israel. And it will be that the king will make the man who kills him wealthy with great riches, and will give him his daughter and make his father’s house free in Israel.”","26":"Then David said to the men who were standing by him, “What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and rids Israel of the disgrace? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he has dared to defy the armies of the living God?”","27":"The people answered him in agreement with this statement, saying, “This is what will be done for the man who kills him.”","28":"Now Eliab his oldest brother heard him when he spoke to the men; and Eliab’s anger burned against David and he said, “Why is it that you have come down? And with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I myself know your insolence and the wickedness of your heart; for you have come down in order to see the battle.”","29":"But David said, “What have I done now? Was it not just a question?”","30":"Then he turned away from him to another and said the same thing; and the people replied with the same words as before.","31":"When the words that David spoke were heard, they informed Saul, and he sent for him.","32":"And David said to Saul, “May no one’s heart fail on account of him; your servant will go and fight this Philistine!”","33":"But Saul said to David, “You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight him; for you are only a youth, while he has been a warrior since his youth.”","34":"But David said to Saul, “Your servant was tending his father’s sheep. When a lion or a bear came and took a sheep from the flock,","35":"I went out after it and attacked it, and rescued the sheep from its mouth; and when it rose up against me, I grabbed it by its mane and struck it and killed it.","36":"“Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear; and this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, since he has defied the armies of the living God.”","37":"And David said, “The LORD who saved me from the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear, He will save me from the hand of this Philistine.” So Saul said to David, “Go, and may the LORD be with you.”","38":"Then Saul clothed David with his military attire and put a bronze helmet on his head, and outfitted him with armor.","39":"And David strapped on his sword over his military attire and struggled at walking, for he had not trained with the armor. So David said to Saul, “I cannot go with these, because I have not trained with them.” And David took them off.","40":"Then he took his staff in his hand and chose for himself five smooth stones from the brook, and put them in the shepherd’s bag which he had, that is, in his shepherd’s pouch, and his sling was in his hand; and he approached the Philistine.","41":"Then the Philistine came and approached David, with the shield-bearer in front of him.","42":"When the Philistine looked and saw David, he was contemptuous of him; for he was only a youth, and reddish, with a handsome appearance.","43":"So the Philistine said to David, “Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?” And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.","44":"The Philistine also said to David, “Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the sky and the wild animals.”","45":"But David said to the Philistine, “You come to me with a sword, a spear, and a saber, but I come to you in the name of the LORD of armies, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.","46":"“This day the LORD will hand you over to me, and I will strike you and remove your head from you. Then I will give the dead bodies of the army of the Philistines this day to the birds of the sky and the wild animals of the earth, so that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel,","47":"and that this entire assembly may know that the LORD does not save by sword or by spear; for the battle is the LORD’S, and He will hand you over to us!”","48":"Then it happened, when the Philistine came closer to meet David, that David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the Philistine.","49":"And David put his hand into his bag and took from it a stone and slung it, and struck the Philistine on his forehead. And the stone penetrated his forehead, and he fell on his face to the ground.","50":"So David prevailed over the Philistine with the sling and the stone: he struck the Philistine and killed him, and there was no sword in David’s hand.","51":"Then David ran and stood over the Philistine, and took his sword and drew it out of its sheath and finished him, and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.","52":"Then the men of Israel and Judah rose up and shouted, and they pursued the Philistines as far as the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the Philistine dead lay along the way to Shaaraim, even to Gath and Ekron.","53":"Then the sons of Israel returned from their close pursuit of the Philistines, and plundered their camps.","54":"And David took the Philistine’s head and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put his weapons in his tent.","55":"Now when Saul had seen David going out against the Philistine, he said to Abner the commander of the army, “Abner, whose son is this young man?” And Abner said, “By your life, O king, I do not know.”","56":"And the king said, “You then, ask whose son the youth is.”","57":"So when David returned from killing the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul with the Philistine’s head in his hand.","58":"Then Saul said to him, “Whose son are you, young man?” And David answered, “I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.”"},"18":{"1":"Now it came about, when he had finished speaking to Saul, that Jonathan committed himself to David, and Jonathan loved him as himself.","2":"And Saul took him that day and did not let him return to his father’s house.","3":"Then Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself.","4":"Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him and gave it to David, with his military gear, including his sword, his bow, and his belt.","5":"And David went into battle wherever Saul sent him, and always achieved success; so Saul put him in charge of the men of war. And it was pleasing in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul’s servants.","6":"Now it happened as they were coming, when David returned from killing the Philistine, that the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet King Saul, with tambourines, with joy and with other musical instruments.","7":"The women sang as they played, and said,\n“Saul has slain his thousands,\nAnd David his ten thousands.”","8":"Then Saul became very angry, for this lyric displeased him; and he said, “They have given David credit for ten thousands, but to me they have given credit for only thousands! Now what more can he have but the kingdom?”","9":"And Saul eyed David with suspicion from that day on.","10":"Now it came about on the next day that an evil spirit from God rushed upon Saul, and he raved in the midst of the house while David was playing the harp with his hand, as usual; and a spear was in Saul’s hand.","11":"Then Saul hurled the spear, for he thought, “I will pin David to the wall.” But David escaped from his presence, twice.","12":"Now Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him but had left Saul.","13":"So Saul removed him from his presence and appointed him as his commander of a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.","14":"David was successful in all his ways, for the LORD was with him.","15":"When Saul saw that he was very successful, he was afraid of him.","16":"But all Israel and Judah loved David, for he would go out to battle and return before them.","17":"Then Saul said to David, “Here is my older daughter Merab; I will give her to you as a wife, only be a valiant man for me and fight the LORD’S battles.” For Saul thought, “My hand shall not be against him, but let the hand of the Philistines be against him.”","18":"But David said to Saul, “Who am I, and who is my family, or my father’s family in Israel, that I should be the king’s son-in-law?”","19":"So it came about at the time that Merab, Saul’s daughter, was to be given to David, that she was given instead to Adriel the Meholathite as a wife.","20":"Now Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved David. When they informed Saul, the thing was pleasing to him.","21":"For Saul thought, “I will give her to him so that she may become a trap for him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.” Therefore Saul said to David, “For a second time you may become my son-in-law, today.”","22":"Then Saul commanded his servants, “Speak to David in secret, saying, ‘Behold, the king delights in you, and all his servants love you; now then, become the king’s son-in-law.’”","23":"So Saul’s servants spoke these words to David. But David said, “Is it trivial in your sight to become the king’s son-in-law, since I am only a poor man and insignificant?”","24":"Then Saul’s servants reported to him, saying, “These are the words David spoke.”","25":"Saul then said, “This is what you shall say to David: ‘The king does not desire any dowry except a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to take vengeance on the king’s enemies.’” But Saul plotted to have David fall by the hand of the Philistines.","26":"When his servants told David these words, it pleased David to become the king’s son-in-law. So before the time had expired,","27":"David set out and went, he and his men, and fatally struck two hundred men among the Philistines. Then David brought their foreskins, and they presented all two hundred of them to the king, so that he might become the king’s son-in-law. And Saul gave him his daughter Michal as a wife.","28":"When Saul saw and realized that the LORD was with David, and that Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved him,","29":"then Saul was even more afraid of David. So Saul was David’s enemy continually.","30":"Then the commanders of the Philistines went to battle, and it happened as often as they went out, that David was more successful than all the servants of Saul. So his name was held in high esteem."},"19":{"1":"Now Saul told his son Jonathan and all his servants to put David to death. But Jonathan, Saul’s son, greatly delighted in David.","2":"So Jonathan informed David, saying, “My father Saul is seeking to put you to death. Now then, please be on your guard in the morning, and stay in a hiding place and conceal yourself.","3":"“And as for me, I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are hiding, and I will speak with my father about you; and whatever I find out, I will tell you.”","4":"Then Jonathan spoke well of David to his father Saul and said to him, “May the king not sin against his servant David, since he has not sinned against you, and since his deeds have been very beneficial to you.","5":"“For he took his life in his hand and struck the Philistine, and the LORD brought about a great victory for all Israel; you saw it and rejoiced. Why then would you sin against innocent blood by putting David to death for no reason?”","6":"Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan, and Saul vowed, “As the LORD lives, David shall not be put to death.”","7":"Then Jonathan called David, and Jonathan told him all these words. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence as before.","8":"When there was war again, David went out and fought the Philistines and defeated them with great slaughter, so that they fled from him.","9":"Now there was an evil spirit from the LORD on Saul as he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand, and David was playing the harp with his hand.","10":"And Saul tried to pin David to the wall with the spear, but he escaped from Saul’s presence, so that he stuck the spear into the wall. And David fled and escaped that night.","11":"Then Saul sent messengers to David’s house to watch him, in order to put him to death in the morning. But Michal, David’s wife, informed him, saying, “If you do not save your life tonight, tomorrow you will be put to death!”","12":"So Michal let David down through a window, and he went and fled, and escaped.","13":"And Michal took the household idol and laid it on the bed, and put a quilt of goats’ hair at its head, and covered it with clothing.","14":"When Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, “He is sick.”","15":"Then Saul sent messengers to see David, saying, “Bring him up to me on his bed, so that I may put him to death.”","16":"When the messengers entered, behold, the household idol was on the bed with the quilt of goats’ hair at its head.","17":"So Saul said to Michal, “Why have you betrayed me like this and let my enemy go, so that he has escaped?” And Michal said to Saul, “He said to me, ‘Let me go! Why should I put you to death?’”","18":"So David fled and escaped, and came to Samuel at Ramah; and he informed him of everything that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and stayed in Naioth.","19":"But it was reported to Saul, saying, “Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.”","20":"Then Saul sent messengers to take David, but when they saw the company of prophets prophesying, with Samuel standing and presiding over them, the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul; and they also prophesied.","21":"When Saul was informed of this, he sent other messengers, but they also prophesied. So Saul sent messengers again the third time, yet they prophesied.","22":"Then he went to Ramah himself and came as far as the large well that is in Secu; and he asked, “Where are Samuel and David?” And someone said, “Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah.”","23":"So he proceeded there to Naioth in Ramah; but the Spirit of God came upon him also, so that he went along prophesying continually until he came to Naioth in Ramah.","24":"He also stripped off his clothes, and he too prophesied before Samuel and lay down naked all that day and all night. Therefore they say, “Is Saul also among the prophets?”"},"20":{"1":"Then David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and he came and said to Jonathan, “What have I done? What is my guilt? And what is my sin before your father, that he is seeking my life?”","2":"He said to him, “Far from it, you shall not die! Behold, my father does nothing either great or small without informing me. So why would my father hide this thing from me? It is not so!”","3":"Yet David vowed again, saying, “Your father is well aware that I have found favor in your sight, and he has said, ‘Jonathan is not to know this, otherwise he will be worried.’ But indeed as the LORD lives and as your soul lives, there is just a step between me and death.”","4":"Then Jonathan said to David, “Whatever you say, I will do for you.”","5":"So David said to Jonathan, “Behold, tomorrow is the new moon, and I am obligated to sit down to eat with the king. But let me go so that I may hide myself in the field until the third evening.","6":"“If your father misses me at all, then say, ‘David earnestly requested leave of me to run to Bethlehem, his city, because it is the yearly sacrifice there for the whole family.’","7":"“If he says, ‘That is good,’ your servant will be safe; but if he is very angry, be aware that he has decided on evil.","8":"“So deal kindly with your servant, for you have brought your servant into a covenant of the LORD with you. But if I am guilty of wrongdoing, kill me yourself; for why then should you bring me to your father?”","9":"Jonathan said, “Far be it from you! For if I in fact learn that my father has decided to inflict harm on you, would I not inform you?”","10":"Then David said to Jonathan, “Who will inform me if your father answers you harshly?”","11":"Jonathan said to David, “Come, and let’s go out to the field.” So both of them went out to the field.","12":"Then Jonathan said to David, “The LORD, the God of Israel, is my witness! When I have sounded out my father about this time tomorrow or the third day, behold, if he has a good feeling toward you, shall I not then send word to you and inform you?","13":"“If it pleases my father to do you harm, may the LORD do so to me and more so, if I fail to inform you and send you away, so that you may go in safety. And may the LORD be with you as He has been with my father.","14":"“And if I am still alive, will you not show me the faithfulness of the LORD, so that I do not die?","15":"“And you shall never cut off your loyalty to my house, not even when the LORD cuts off every one of the enemies of David from the face of the earth.”","16":"So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, “May the LORD demand it from the hands of David’s enemies.”","17":"And Jonathan made David vow again because of his love for him, because he loved him as he loved his own life.","18":"Then Jonathan said to him, “Tomorrow is the new moon, and you will be missed since your seat will be empty.","19":"“When you have stayed for three days, you shall go down quickly and come to the place where you hid yourself on that eventful day, and you shall remain beside the stone Ezel.","20":"“And I will shoot three arrows to the side, as though I shot at a target.","21":"“Then behold, I will send the boy, telling him, ‘Go, find the arrows.’ If I specifically say to the boy, ‘Behold, the arrows are on this side of you, get them,’ then come, because it is safe for you and there is nothing to harm you, as the LORD lives.","22":"“But if I say to the youth, ‘Behold, the arrows are beyond you,’ go, because the LORD has sent you away.","23":"“As for the agreement of which you and I have spoken, behold, the LORD is between you and me forever.”","24":"So David hid himself in the field; and when the new moon came, the king sat down to eat food.","25":"Now the king sat on his seat as usual, the seat by the wall; then Jonathan stood up and Abner sat down by Saul’s side; but David’s place was empty.","26":"Nevertheless Saul did not say anything that day, because he thought, “It must have been an accident; he is not clean, undoubtedly he is not clean.”","27":"But it came about the next day, the second day of the new moon, that David’s place was empty again; so Saul said to his son Jonathan, “Why has the son of Jesse not come to the meal, either yesterday or today?”","28":"And Jonathan answered Saul, “David earnestly requested leave of me to go to Bethlehem.","29":"“He said, ‘Please let me go, because our family has a sacrifice in the city, and my brother has ordered me to attend. So now, if I have found favor in your sight, please let me slip away so that I may see my brothers.’ For this reason he has not come to the king’s table.”","30":"Then Saul’s anger burned against Jonathan, and he said to him, “You son of a perverse, rebellious woman! Do I not know that you are choosing the son of Jesse to your own shame, and to the shame of your mother’s nakedness?","31":"“For, as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, neither you nor your kingdom will be established. Now then, send men and bring him to me, for he is doomed to die!”","32":"But Jonathan replied to his father Saul and said to him, “Why must he be put to death? What has he done?”","33":"Then Saul hurled his spear at him to strike and kill him; so Jonathan knew that his father had decided to put David to death.","34":"Then Jonathan got up from the table in the heat of anger, and did not eat food on the second day of the new moon, because he was worried about David since his father had insulted him.","35":"Now it came about in the morning that Jonathan went out to the field at the time agreed upon with David, and a little boy was with him.","36":"He said to his boy, “Run, find now the arrows which I am about to shoot.” The boy ran, and he shot an arrow past him.","37":"When the boy reached the location of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan called after the boy and said, “Is the arrow not beyond you?”","38":"Then Jonathan called after the boy, “Hurry, be quick, do not stay!” And Jonathan’s boy picked up the arrow and came to his master.","39":"But the boy was not aware of anything; only Jonathan and David knew about the matter.","40":"Then Jonathan gave his weapons to his boy and said to him, “Go, bring them to the city.”","41":"When the boy was gone, David got up from the south side, then he fell on his face to the ground and bowed three times. And they kissed each other and wept together, until David wept immeasurably.","42":"Then Jonathan said to David, “Go in safety, since we have sworn to each other in the name of the LORD, saying, ‘The LORD will be between me and you, and between my descendants and your descendants forever.’” So David set out and went on his way, while Jonathan went into the city."},"21":{"1":"Then David came to Nob, to Ahimelech the priest; and Ahimelech came trembling to meet David and said to him, “Why are you alone, and no one with you?”","2":"David said to Ahimelech the priest, “The king has commissioned me with a matter and has said to me, ‘No one is to know anything about the matter on which I am sending you and with which I have commissioned you; and I have directed the young men to a certain place.’","3":"“Now then, what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever can be found.”","4":"The priest answered David and said, “There is no ordinary bread on hand, but there is consecrated bread, if only the young men have kept themselves from women.”","5":"David answered the priest and said to him, “Be assured, women have been denied to us as previously when I left and the bodies of the young men were consecrated, though it was an ordinary journey; how much more then will their bodies be consecrated today?”","6":"So the priest gave him consecrated bread; for there was no bread there except the bread of the Presence which was removed from its place before the LORD, in order to put hot bread in its place on the day it was taken away.","7":"Now one of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the LORD; and his name was Doeg the Edomite, the chief of Saul’s shepherds.","8":"David said to Ahimelech, “Now is there no spear or sword on hand? For I brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king’s matter was urgent.”","9":"Then the priest said, “The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the Valley of Elah, behold, it is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod; if you would take it for yourself, take it. For there is no other except it here.” And David said, “There is none like it; give it to me.”","10":"Then David set out and fled that day from Saul, and went to Achish king of Gath.","11":"But the servants of Achish said to him, “Is this not David, the king of the land? Did they not sing of this one as they danced, saying,\n‘Saul has slain his thousands,\nAnd David his ten thousands’?”","12":"David took these words to heart and greatly feared Achish king of Gath.","13":"So he disguised his sanity while in their sight and acted insanely in their custody, and he scribbled on the doors of the gate, and drooled on his beard.","14":"Then Achish said to his servants, “Look, you see the man is behaving like an insane person. Why do you bring him to me?","15":"“Do I lack insane people, that you have brought this one to behave like an insane person in my presence? Shall this one come into my house?”"},"22":{"1":"So David departed from there and escaped to the cave of Adullam; and when his brothers and all his father’s household heard about it, they went down there to him.","2":"Then everyone who was in distress, and everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was discontented gathered to him; and he became captain over them. Now there were about four hundred men with him.","3":"And David went from there to Mizpah of Moab; and he said to the king of Moab, “Please let my father and my mother come and stay with you until I know what God will do for me.”","4":"Then he left them with the king of Moab; and they stayed with him all the time that David was in the stronghold.","5":"But Gad the prophet said to David, “Do not stay in the stronghold; leave, and go into the land of Judah.” So David left and went into the forest of Hereth.","6":"Then Saul heard that David and the men who were with him had been discovered. Now Saul was in Gibeah, sitting under the tamarisk tree on the height with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing in front of him.","7":"Saul said to his servants who were standing in front of him, “Hear now, you Benjaminites! Will the son of Jesse really give all of you fields and vineyards? Will he make you all commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds?","8":"“For all of you have conspired against me so that there is no one who informs me when my son makes a covenant with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you who cares about me or informs me that my son has stirred up my servant against me to lie in ambush, as it is this day.”","9":"Then Doeg the Edomite, who was standing in front of the servants of Saul, responded and said, “I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.","10":"“And he inquired of the LORD for him, gave him provisions, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.”","11":"Then the king sent a messenger to summon Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father’s household, the priests who were in Nob; and all of them came to the king.","12":"Saul said, “Listen now, son of Ahitub.” And he replied, “Here I am, my lord.”","13":"Saul then said to him, “Why have you and the son of Jesse conspired against me, in that you have given him bread and a sword, and have inquired of God for him, so that he would rise up against me by lying in ambush as it is this day?”","14":"Then Ahimelech answered the king and said, “And who among all your servants is as faithful as David, the king’s own son-in-law, who is commander over your bodyguard, and is honored in your house?","15":"“Did I just begin to inquire of God for him today? Far be it from me! Do not let the king impute anything against his servant or against any of the household of my father, because your servant knows nothing at all of this whole affair.”","16":"But the king said, “You shall certainly die, Ahimelech, you and all your father’s household!”","17":"And the king said to the guards who were attending him, “Turn around and put the priests of the LORD to death, because their hand also is with David and because they knew that he was fleeing and did not inform me.” But the servants of the king were unwilling to reach out with their hands to attack the priests of the LORD.","18":"Then the king said to Doeg, “You, turn around and attack the priests!” And Doeg the Edomite turned around and attacked the priests, and he killed on that day eighty-five men who wore the linen ephod.","19":"He also struck Nob the city of the priests with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and infants; he also struck oxen, donkeys, and sheep with the edge of the sword.","20":"But one son of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped and fled to David.","21":"Abiathar informed David that Saul had killed the priests of the LORD.","22":"Then David said to Abiathar, “I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would certainly tell Saul. I myself have turned against every person in your father’s household.","23":"“Stay with me; do not be afraid, even though he who is seeking my life is seeking your life.

How much more then if we go to Keilah against the ranks of the Philistines?”","4":"So David inquired of the LORD once more. And the LORD answered him and said, “Arise, go down to Keilah, for I am going to hand the Philistines over to you.”","5":"Then David and his men went to Keilah and fought the Philistines; and he drove away their livestock and struck them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.","6":"Now it came about, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David at Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.","7":"When it was reported to Saul that David had come to Keilah, Saul said, “God has handed him over to me, for he shut himself in by entering a city with double gates and bars.”","8":"So Saul summoned all the people for war, to go down to Keilah to besiege David and his men.","9":"But David knew that Saul was plotting evil against him; so he said to Abiathar the priest, “Bring the ephod here.”","10":"Then David said, “LORD God of Israel, Your servant has heard for certain that Saul is seeking to come to Keilah to destroy the city on my account.","11":"“Will the citizens of Keilah hand me over to him? Will Saul come down just as Your servant has heard? LORD God of Israel, please, tell Your servant.” And the LORD said, “He will come down.”","12":"Then David said, “Will the citizens of Keilah hand me and my men over to Saul?” And the LORD said, “They will hand you over.”","13":"Then David and his men, about six hundred, rose up and departed from Keilah, and they went wherever they could go. When it was reported to Saul that David had escaped from Keilah, he gave up the pursuit.","14":"David stayed in the wilderness in the strongholds, and remained in the hill country in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul searched for him every day, but God did not hand him over to him.","15":"Now David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life while David was in the wilderness of Ziph, at Horesh.","16":"And Jonathan, Saul’s son, set out and went to David at Horesh, and encouraged him in God.","17":"He said to him, “Do not be afraid, because the hand of Saul my father will not find you, and you will be king over Israel, and I will be second in command to you; and Saul my father knows that as well.”","18":"So the two of them made a covenant before the LORD; and David stayed at Horesh, while Jonathan went to his house.","19":"Then Ziphites came up to Saul at Gibeah, saying, “Is David not keeping himself hidden with us in the strongholds at Horesh, on the hill of Hachilah, which is south of Jeshimon?","20":"“Now then, O king, come down, since you fully desire to do so; and our part shall be to hand him over to the king.”","21":"Saul said, “May you be blessed of the LORD, since you have had compassion on me.","22":"“Go now, be more persistent, and investigate and see his place where he is hiding, and who has seen him there; for I am told that he is very cunning.","23":"“So look, and learn about all the hiding places where he keeps himself hidden, and return to me with certainty, and I will go with you; and if he is in the land, I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah.”","24":"So they set out and went to Ziph ahead of Saul. Now David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah to the south of Jeshimon.","25":"When Saul and his men went to seek him, they informed David, and he came down to the rock and stayed in the wilderness of Maon.

Now David and his men were sitting in the inner recesses of the cave.","4":"Then David’s men said to him, “Behold, this is the day of which the LORD said to you, ‘Behold; I am about to hand your enemy over to you, and you shall do to him as it seems good to you.’” Then David got up and cut off the edge of Saul’s robe secretly.","5":"But it came about afterward that David’s conscience bothered him because he had cut off the edge of Saul’s robe.","6":"So he said to his men, “Far be it from me because of the LORD that I would do this thing to my lord, the LORD’S anointed, to reach out with my hand against him, since he is the LORD’S anointed.”","7":"And David rebuked his men with these words and did not allow them to rise up against Saul. And Saul got up, left the cave, and went on his way.","8":"Afterward, however, David got up and went out of the cave, and called after Saul, saying, “My lord the king!” And when Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the ground and prostrated himself.","9":"And David said to Saul, “Why do you listen to the words of men who say, ‘Behold, David is seeking to harm you’?","10":"“Behold, this day your eyes have seen that the LORD had handed you over to me today in the cave, and someone said to kill you, but I spared you; and I said, ‘I will not reach out with my hand against my lord, because he is the LORD’S anointed.’","11":"“So, my father, look! Indeed, look at the edge of your robe in my hand! For by the fact that I cut off the edge of your robe but did not kill you, know and understand that there is no evil or rebellion in my hands, and I have not sinned against you, though you are lying in wait for my life, to take it.","12":"“May the LORD judge between you and me, and may the LORD take vengeance on you for me; but my hand shall not be against you.","13":"“As the proverb of the ancients says, ‘Out of the wicked comes wickedness’; but my hand shall not be against you.","14":"“After whom has the king of Israel gone out? Whom are you pursuing? A dead dog, a single flea?","15":"“May the LORD therefore be judge and decide between you and me; and may He see and plead my cause and save me from your hand.”","16":"When David had finished speaking these words to Saul, Saul said, “Is this your voice, my son David?” Then Saul raised his voice and wept.","17":"And he said to David, “You are more righteous than I; for you have dealt well with me, while I have dealt maliciously with you.","18":"“You have declared today that you have done good to me, that the LORD handed me over to you and yet you did not kill me.","19":"“Though if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go away unharmed?

Then Saul went to his home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold."},"25":{"1":"Then Samuel died; and all Israel assembled and mourned for him, and they buried him at his house in Ramah. And David set out and went down to the wilderness of Paran.","2":"Now there was a man in Maon whose business was in Carmel; and the man was very rich, and he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats. And it came about while he was shearing his sheep in Carmel","3":"(now the man’s name was Nabal, and his wife’s name was Abigail. And the woman was intelligent and beautiful in appearance, but the man was harsh and evil in his dealings, and he was a Calebite),","4":"that David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.","5":"So David sent ten young men; and David said to the young men, “Go up to Carmel and visit Nabal, and greet him in my name;","6":"and this is what you shall say: ‘Have a long life, peace to you, and peace to your house, and peace to all that you have!","7":"‘Now then, I have heard that you have shearers. Now, your shepherds have been with us; we have not harmed them, nor has anything of theirs gone missing all the days they were in Carmel.","8":"‘Ask your young men and they will tell you. Therefore let my young men find favor in your eyes, for we have come on a festive day. Please give whatever you find at hand to your servants and to your son David.’”","9":"When David’s young men came, they spoke to Nabal in accordance with all these words in David’s name; then they waited.","10":"But Nabal answered David’s servants and said, “Who is David? And who is the son of Jesse? There are many servants today who are each breaking away from his master.","11":"“Shall I then take my bread and my water and my meat that I have slaughtered for my shearers, and give it to men whose origin I do not know?”","12":"So David’s young men made their way back and returned; and they came and informed him in accordance with all these words.","13":"Then David said to his men, “Each of you strap on his sword.” So each man strapped on his sword. And David also strapped on his sword, and about four hundred men went up behind David, while two hundred stayed with the baggage.","14":"Now one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying, “Behold, David sent messengers from the wilderness to greet our master, and he spoke to them in anger.","15":"“Yet the men were very good to us, and we were not harmed, nor did anything go missing as long as we went with them, while we were in the fields.","16":"“They were a wall to us both by night and by day, all the time we were with them tending the sheep.","17":"“Now then, be aware and consider what you should do, because harm is plotted against our master and against all his household; and he is such a worthless man that no one can speak to him.”","18":"Then Abigail hurried and took two hundred loaves of bread and two jugs of wine, and five sheep already prepared and five measures of roasted grain, and a hundred cakes of raisins and two hundred cakes of figs, and she loaded them on donkeys.","19":"Then she said to her young men, “Go on ahead of me; behold, I am coming after you.” But she did not tell her husband Nabal.","20":"And it happened as she was riding on her donkey and coming down by the hidden part of the mountain, that behold, David and his men were coming down toward her; so she met them.","21":"Now David had said, “It is certainly for nothing that I have guarded everything that this man has in the wilderness, so that nothing has gone missing of all that belonged to him! For he has returned me evil for good.","22":"“May God do so to the enemies of David, and more so, if by morning I leave alive as much as one male of any who belong to him.”","23":"When Abigail saw David, she hurried and dismounted from her donkey, and fell on her face in front of David and bowed herself to the ground.","24":"She fell at his feet and said, “On me alone, my lord, be the blame. And please let your slave speak to you, and listen to the words of your slave.","25":"“Please do not let my lord pay attention to this worthless man, Nabal, for as his name is, so is he. Nabal is his name, and stupidity is with him; but I your slave did not see the young men of my lord whom you sent.","26":"“Now then, my lord, as the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, since the LORD has restrained you from shedding blood, and from avenging yourself by your own hand, now then, may your enemies and those who seek evil against my lord, be like Nabal.","27":"“And now let this gift which your servant has brought to my lord be given to the young men who accompany my lord.","28":"“Please forgive the offense of your slave; for the LORD will certainly make for my lord an enduring house, because my lord is fighting the battles of the LORD, and evil will not be found in you all your days.","29":"“Should anyone rise up to pursue you and to seek your life, then the life of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of the living with the LORD your God; but the lives of your enemies He will sling out as from the hollow of a sling.","30":"“And when the LORD does for my lord in accordance with all the good that He has spoken concerning you, and appoints you ruler over Israel,","31":"this will not become an obstacle to you, or a troubled heart to my lord, both by having shed blood without cause and by my lord’s having avenged himself.

See, I have listened to you and granted your request.”","36":"Then Abigail came to Nabal, and behold, he was having a feast in his house, like the feast of a king. And Nabal’s heart was cheerful within him, for he was very drunk; so she did not tell him anything at all until the morning light.","37":"But in the morning, when the wine had gone out of Nabal, his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him so that he became like a stone.","38":"About ten days later, the LORD struck Nabal and he died.","39":"When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, “Blessed be the LORD, who has pleaded the cause of the shame inflicted on me by the hand of Nabal, and has kept back His servant from evil. The LORD has also returned the evildoing of Nabal on his own head.” Then David sent a proposal to Abigail, to take her as his wife.","40":"When the servants of David came to Abigail at Carmel, they spoke to her, saying, “David has sent us to you to take you to him as his wife.”","41":"And she got up and bowed with her face to the ground, and said, “Behold, your slave is a servant to wash the feet of my lord’s servants.”","42":"Then Abigail got up quickly, and rode on a donkey, with her five female attendants who accompanied her; and she followed the messengers of David and became his wife.","43":"David had also taken Ahinoam of Jezreel, and they both became his wives.","44":"But Saul had given his daughter Michal, David’s wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was from Gallim."},"26":{"1":"Then the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah, saying, “Is David not keeping himself hidden on the hill of Hachilah, which is opposite Jeshimon?”","2":"So Saul set out and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, taking with him three thousand chosen men of Israel, to search for David in the wilderness of Ziph.","3":"And Saul camped on the hill of Hachilah, which is opposite Jeshimon, beside the road, and David was staying in the wilderness.

As the LORD lives, all of you undoubtedly must die, because you did not guard your lord, the LORD’S anointed.

There is nothing better for me than to safely escape into the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will despair of searching for me anymore in all the territory of Israel, and I will escape from his hand.”","2":"So David set out and went over, he and the six hundred men who were with him, to Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath.","3":"And David lived with Achish in Gath, he and his men, each with his own household—David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal’s widow.","4":"Now it was reported to Saul that David had fled to Gath, so he no longer searched for him.","5":"Then David said to Achish, “If now I have found favor in your sight, have them give me a place in one of the cities in the country, so that I may live there; for why should your servant live in the royal city with you?”","6":"So Achish gave him Ziklag that day; therefore Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah to this day.","7":"The number of days that David lived in the country of the Philistines was a year and four months.","8":"Now David and his men went up and attacked the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites; for they were the inhabitants of the land from ancient times, as you come to Shur even as far as the land of Egypt.","9":"David attacked the land and did not leave a man or a woman alive, and he took the sheep, the cattle, the donkeys, the camels, and the clothing. Then he returned and came to Achish.","10":"Now Achish said, “Where did you carry out an attack today?” And David said, “Against the Negev of Judah, against the Negev of the Jerahmeelites, and against the Negev of the Kenites.”","11":"And David did not leave a man or a woman alive to bring to Gath, saying, “Otherwise they will tell about us, saying, ‘This is what David has done, and this has been his practice all the time that he has lived in the country of the Philistines.’”","12":"So Achish believed David, saying, “He has undoubtedly made himself repulsive among his people Israel; therefore he will become my servant forever.”"},"28":{"1":"Now it came about in those days that the Philistines gathered their armed camps for war, to fight against Israel.

And Saul had removed the mediums and spiritists from the land.","4":"So the Philistines assembled and came and camped in Shunem; and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they camped in Gilboa.","5":"When Saul saw the camp of the Philistines, he was afraid and his heart trembled greatly.","6":"So Saul inquired of the LORD, but the LORD did not answer him, either in dreams, or by the Urim, or by the prophets.","7":"Then Saul said to his servants, “Find for me a woman who is a medium, so that I may go to her and inquire of her.” And his servants said to him, “Behold, there is a woman who is a medium at En-dor.”","8":"Then Saul disguised himself by putting on different clothes, and went, he and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night; and he said, “Consult the spirit for me, please, and bring up for me the one whom I shall name for you.”","9":"But the woman said to him, “Behold, you know what Saul has done, that he has eliminated the mediums and spiritists from the land. Why are you then setting a trap for my life, to bring about my death?”","10":"So Saul swore an oath to her by the LORD, saying, “As the LORD lives, no punishment shall come upon you for this thing.”","11":"Then the woman said, “Whom shall I bring up for you?” And he said, “Bring up Samuel for me.”","12":"When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud voice; and the woman spoke to Saul, saying, “Why have you deceived me? For you are Saul!”","13":"But the king said to her, “Do not be afraid; but what do you see?” And the woman said to Saul, “I see a divine being coming up from the earth.”","14":"He said to her, “How does he appear?” And she said, “An old man is coming up, and he is wrapped in a robe.” Then Saul knew that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground and paid homage.","15":"And Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?” Saul replied, “I am very distressed, for the Philistines are waging war against me, and God has abandoned me and no longer answers me, either through prophets or in dreams; therefore I have called you, so that you may let me know what I should do.”","16":"Samuel said, “But why ask me, since the LORD has abandoned you and has become your enemy?","17":"“And the LORD has done just as He spoke through me; for the LORD has torn the kingdom from your hand and given it to your neighbor, to David.","18":"“Just as you did not obey the LORD and did not execute His fierce wrath on Amalek, so the LORD has done this thing to you this day.","19":"“Furthermore, the LORD will also hand Israel along with you over to the Philistines; so tomorrow you and your sons will be with me. Indeed, the LORD will hand the army of Israel over to the Philistines!”","20":"Then Saul immediately fell full length to the ground and was very afraid because of Samuel’s words; there was no strength in him either, because he had eaten no food all day and all night.","21":"The woman came to Saul and saw that he was utterly horrified, and she said to him, “Behold, your servant has obeyed you, and I have taken my life in my hand and have listened to your words which you spoke to me.","22":"“So now you too, please listen to the voice of your servant, and let me serve you a piece of bread, and eat it, so that you will have strength when you go on your way.”","23":"But he refused and said, “I will not eat.” However, his servants together with the woman urged him, and he listened to them. So he got up from the ground and sat on the bed.","24":"Now the woman had a fattened calf in the house, and she quickly slaughtered it; then she took flour, kneaded it and baked unleavened bread from it.","25":"She then served it to Saul and his servants, and they ate.

Would it not be with the heads of these men?","5":"“Is this not David, of whom they sing in the dances, saying,\n‘Saul has slain his thousands,\nAnd David his ten thousands’?”","6":"Then Achish called David and said to him, “As the LORD lives, you have indeed been honest, and your going out and your coming in with me in the army are pleasing in my sight; for I have not found evil in you since the day of your coming to me to this day. Nevertheless, you are not pleasing in the sight of the governors.","7":"“Now then, return and go in peace, so that you will not do anything wrong in the sight of the governors of the Philistines.”","8":"However, David said to Achish, “But what have I done? And what have you found in your servant since the day that I came before you, to this day, that I cannot go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?”","9":"But Achish replied to David, “I know that you are pleasing in my sight, like an angel of God; nevertheless the commanders of the Philistines have said, ‘He must not go up with us into the battle.’","10":"“Now then, rise early in the morning with the servants of your lord who have come with you, and as soon as you have risen early in the morning and have light, leave.”","11":"So David got up early, he and his men, to leave in the morning to return to the land of the Philistines.

For the LORD has spoken regarding David, saying, ‘By the hand of My servant David I will save My people Israel from the hand of the Philistines, and from the hands of all their enemies.’”","19":"Abner also spoke to Benjamin; and in addition Abner went to speak to David in Hebron everything that seemed good to Israel and to the entire house of Benjamin.","20":"Then Abner and twenty men with him came to David at Hebron. And David held a feast for Abner and the men who were with him.","21":"Abner said to David, “Let me set out and go and gather all Israel to my lord the king, so that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may be king over all that your soul desires.” So David let Abner go, and he went in peace.","22":"And behold, the servants of David and Joab came from a raid and brought a large amount of plunder with them; but Abner was not with David in Hebron, since he had let him go, and he had gone in peace.","23":"When Joab and all the army that was with him arrived, they informed Joab, saying, “Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has let him go on his way, and he has gone in peace.”","24":"Then Joab came to the king and said, “What have you done? Behold, Abner came to you; why then have you let him go, so that he is already gone?","25":"“You know Abner the son of Ner, that he came to gain your confidence, and to learn of your going out and coming in and to find out everything that you are doing.”","26":"When Joab left David’s presence, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah; but David did not know about it.","27":"So when Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the middle of the gate to speak with him privately, and there he struck him in the belly, so that he died on account of the blood of his brother Asahel.","28":"Afterward, when David heard about this, he said, “I and my kingdom are innocent before the LORD forever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner.","29":"“May it turn upon the head of Joab and on all his father’s house; and may there not be eliminated from the house of Joab someone who suffers a discharge, or has leprosy, or holds the spindle, or falls by the sword, or lacks bread.”","30":"So Joab and his brother Abishai killed Abner because he had put their brother Asahel to death in the battle at Gibeon.","31":"Then David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him, “Tear your clothes and put on sackcloth, and mourn before Abner.” And King David walked behind the bier.","32":"And they buried Abner in Hebron; and the king raised his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept.","33":"And the king sang a song of mourning for Abner and said,\n“Should Abner die as a fool dies?","34":"“Your hands were not bound, nor your feet put in bronze shackles;\nAs one falls before the wicked, you have fallen.”\nAnd all the people wept over him again.","35":"Then all the people came to provide food for David in his distress while it was still day; but David vowed, saying, “May God do so to me, and more so, if I taste bread or anything else before the sun goes down.”","36":"Now all the people took note of David’s vow, and it pleased them, just as everything that the king did pleased all the people.","37":"So all the people and all Israel understood on that day that it had not been the desire of the king to put Abner the son of Ner to death.","38":"Then the king said to his servants, “Do you not know that a leader and a great man has fallen in Israel this day?","39":"“And I am weak today, though anointed king; and these men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too difficult for me. May the LORD repay the evildoer in proportion to his evil.”"},"4":{"1":"Now when Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son, heard that Abner had died in Hebron, his courage failed, and all Israel was horrified.","2":"And Saul’s son had two men who were commanders of troops: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the sons of Benjamin (for Beeroth is also considered part of Benjamin,","3":"and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim and have lived there as strangers until this day).","4":"Now Jonathan, Saul’s son, had a son who was disabled in both feet. He was five years old when the news of Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel, and his nurse picked him up and fled. But it happened that in her hurry to flee, he fell and could no longer walk. And his name was Mephibosheth.","5":"So the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, departed and came to the house of Ish-bosheth in the heat of the day, while he was taking his midday rest.","6":"And they came to the interior of the house as if to get wheat, and they struck him in the belly; and Rechab and his brother Baanah escaped.","7":"Now when they had come into the house, as he was lying on his bed in his bedroom, they struck him and killed him, and they beheaded him. And they took his head and traveled by way of the Arabah all night.","8":"Then they brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David at Hebron, and said to the king, “Behold, the head of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life; so the LORD has given my lord the king vengeance this day on Saul and his descendants.”","9":"But David replied to Rechab and his brother Baanah, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, “As the LORD lives, who has redeemed my life from all distress,","10":"when the one who informed me, saying, ‘Behold, Saul is dead,’ also viewed himself as the bearer of good news, I seized him and killed him in Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his news.","11":"“How much more, when wicked men have killed a righteous man in his own house on his bed, shall I not now require his blood from your hands and eliminate you both from the earth?”","12":"Then David commanded the young men, and they killed them and cut off their hands and feet, and hung them up beside the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth and buried it in the grave of Abner in Hebron."},"5":{"1":"Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and said, “Behold, we are your bone and your flesh.","2":"“Previously, when Saul was king over us, you were the one who led Israel out and in. And the LORD said to you, ‘You will shepherd My people Israel, and you will be a leader over Israel.’”","3":"So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and King David made a covenant with them before the LORD in Hebron; then they anointed David king over Israel.","4":"David was thirty years old when he became king, and he reigned for forty years.","5":"At Hebron he reigned over Judah for seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned for thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.","6":"Now the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land; and they said to David, “You shall not come in here, but even those who are blind and those who limp will turn you away,” thinking, “David cannot enter here.”","7":"Nevertheless, David captured the stronghold of Zion, that is, the city of David.","8":"And David said on that day, “Whoever strikes the Jebusites is to reach those who limp and those who are blind, who are hated by David’s soul, through the water tunnel.” For that reason they say, “People who are blind and people who limp shall not come into the house.”","9":"So David lived in the stronghold, and called it the city of David. And David built all around from the Millo and inward.","10":"David became greater and greater, for the LORD God of armies was with him.","11":"Then Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David with cedar trees, carpenters, and stonemasons; and they built a house for David.","12":"And David realized that the LORD had appointed him as king over Israel, and that He had exalted his kingdom for the sake of His people Israel.","13":"Meanwhile David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem, after he came from Hebron; and more sons and daughters were born to David.","14":"Now these are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,","15":"Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia,","16":"Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.","17":"Now when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek out David; and when David heard about it, he went down to the stronghold.","18":"Now the Philistines came and overran the Valley of Rephaim.","19":"So David inquired of the LORD, saying, “Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will You hand them over to me?” And the LORD said to David, “Go up, for I will certainly hand the Philistines over to you.”","20":"Then David came to Baal-perazim and defeated them there; and he said, “The LORD has broken through my enemies before me like the breakthrough of waters.” Therefore he named that place Baal-perazim.","21":"And the Philistines abandoned their idols there, so David and his men carried them away.","22":"Now the Philistines came up once again and overran the Valley of Rephaim.","23":"So David inquired of the LORD, but He said, “You shall not go directly up; circle around behind them and come at them in front of the baka-shrubs.","24":"“And it shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the baka-shrubs, then you shall act promptly, for then the LORD will have gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines.”","25":"Then David did so, just as the LORD had commanded him; he struck and killed the Philistines from Geba as far as Gezer."},"6":{"1":"Now David again gathered all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.","2":"And David departed from Baale-judah, with all the people who were with him, to bring up from there the ark of God which is called by the Name, the very name of the LORD of armies who is enthroned above the cherubim.","3":"They had mounted the ark of God on a new cart and moved it from the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill; and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, were leading the new cart.","4":"So they brought it with the ark of God from the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill; and Ahio was walking ahead of the ark.","5":"Meanwhile, David and all the house of Israel were celebrating before the LORD with all kinds of instruments made of juniper wood, and with lyres, harps, tambourines, castanets, and cymbals.","6":"But when they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah reached out toward the ark of God and took hold of it, because the oxen nearly overturned it.","7":"And the anger of the LORD burned against Uzzah, and God struck him down there for his irreverence; and he died there by the ark of God.","8":"Then David became angry because of the LORD’S outburst against Uzzah; and that place has been called Perez-uzzah to this day.","9":"So David was afraid of the LORD that day; and he said, “How can the ark of the LORD come to me?”","10":"And David was unwilling to move the ark of the LORD into the city of David with him; but David took it aside to the house of Obed-edom, the Gittite.","11":"The ark of the LORD remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite for three months, and the LORD blessed Obed-edom and all his household.","12":"Now it was reported to King David, saying, “The LORD has blessed the house of Obed-edom and all that belongs to him, on account of the ark of God.” So David went and brought the ark of God up from the house of Obed-edom to the city of David with joy.","13":"And so it was, that when those carrying the ark of the LORD marched six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fattened steer.","14":"And David was dancing before the LORD with all his strength, and David was wearing a linen ephod.","15":"So David and all the house of Israel were bringing up the ark of the LORD with joyful shouting and the sound of the trumpet.","16":"Then it happened, as the ark of the LORD was coming into the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked down through the window and saw King David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she was contemptuous of him in her heart.","17":"Now they brought in the ark of the LORD and set it in its place inside the tent which David had pitched for it; and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.","18":"When David had finished offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of armies.","19":"Further, he distributed to all the people, to all the multitude of Israel, both to men and women, a cake of bread, one of dates, and one of raisins to each one. Then all the people left, each to his house.","20":"But when David returned to bless his own household, Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David and said, “How the king of Israel dignified himself today! For he exposed himself today in the sight of his servants’ female slaves, as one of the rabble shamelessly exposes himself!”","21":"But David said to Michal, “I was before the LORD, who preferred me to your father and to all his house, to appoint me as ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel. So I will celebrate before the LORD!","22":"“And I might demean myself even more than this and be lowly in my own sight, but with the female slaves of whom you have spoken, with them I am to be held in honor!”","23":"And Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death."},"7":{"1":"Now it came about, when the king lived in his house, and the LORD had given him rest on every side from all his enemies,","2":"that the king said to Nathan the prophet, “See now, I live in a house of cedar, but the ark of God remains within the tent.”","3":"Nathan said to the king, “Go, do all that is in your mind, for the LORD is with you.”","4":"But in the same night, the word of the LORD came to Nathan, saying,","5":"“Go and say to My servant David, ‘This is what the LORD says: “Should you build Me a house for My dwelling?","6":"“For I have not dwelt in a house since the day I brought up the sons of Israel from Egypt, even to this day; rather, I have been moving about in a tent, that is, in a dwelling place.","7":"“Wherever I have gone with all the sons of Israel, did I speak a word with one of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd My people Israel, saying, ‘Why have you not built Me a house of cedar?’”’","8":"“Now then, this is what you shall say to My servant David: ‘This is what the LORD of armies says: “I Myself took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, to be leader over My people Israel.","9":"“And I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have eliminated all your enemies from you; I will also make a great name for you, like the names of the great men who are on the earth.","10":"“And I will establish a place for My people Israel, and will plant them, so that they may live in their own place and not be disturbed again, nor will malicious people oppress them anymore as previously,","11":"even from the day that I appointed judges over My people Israel; and I will give you rest from all your enemies.

You have struck and killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, you have taken his wife as your wife, and you have slaughtered him with the sword of the sons of Ammon.","10":"‘Now then, the sword shall never leave your house, because you have despised Me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.’","11":"“This is what the LORD says: ‘Behold, I am going to raise up evil against you from your own household; I will even take your wives before your eyes and give them to your companion, and he will sleep with your wives in broad daylight.","12":"‘Indeed, you did it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel, and in open daylight.’”","13":"Then David said to Nathan, “I have sinned against the LORD.” And Nathan said to David, “The LORD also has allowed your sin to pass; you shall not die.","14":"“However, since by this deed you have shown utter disrespect for the LORD, the child himself who is born to you shall certainly die.”","15":"Then Nathan went to his house.\nLater the LORD struck the child that Uriah’s widow bore to David, so that he was very sick.","16":"David therefore pleaded with God for the child; and David fasted and went and lay all night on the ground.","17":"The elders of his household stood beside him in order to help him up from the ground, but he was unwilling and would not eat food with them.","18":"Then it happened on the seventh day that the child died. And David’s servants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they said, “Behold, while the child was still alive, we spoke to him and he did not listen to us. How then can we tell him that the child is dead, since he might do himself harm?”","19":"But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, David perceived that the child was dead; so David said to his servants, “Is the child dead?” And they said, “He is dead.”","20":"So David got up from the ground, washed, anointed himself, and changed his clothes; and he went into the house of the LORD and worshiped. Then he went to his own house, and when he asked, they served him food, and he ate.","21":"Then his servants said to him, “What is this thing that you have done? You fasted and wept for the child while he was alive; but when the child died, you got up and ate food.”","22":"And he said, “While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept; for I said, ‘Who knows, the LORD may be gracious to me, and the child may live.’","23":"“But now he has died; why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I am going to him, but he will not return to me.”","24":"Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba, and went in to her and slept with her; and she gave birth to a son, and he named him Solomon. Now the LORD loved him,","25":"and sent word through Nathan the prophet, and he named him Jedidiah for the LORD’S sake.","26":"Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, and captured the royal city.","27":"Then Joab sent messengers to David and said, “I have fought against Rabbah, I have even captured the city of waters.","28":"“Now then, gather the rest of the people and camp opposite the city and capture it, or I will capture the city myself and it will be named after me.”","29":"So David gathered all the people and went to Rabbah, and he fought against it and captured it.","30":"Then he took the crown of their king from his head; and its weight was a talent of gold, and it had a precious stone; and it was placed on David’s head. And he brought out the plunder of the city in great amounts.","31":"He also brought out the people who were in it, and put some to work at saws, iron picks, and iron axes, and made others serve at the brick works. And he did the same to all the cities of the sons of Ammon. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem."},"13":{"1":"Now it was after this that Absalom the son of David had a beautiful sister whose name was Tamar, and Amnon the son of David was in love with her.","2":"But Amnon was so frustrated on account of his sister Tamar that he made himself ill, for she was a virgin, and it seemed too difficult to Amnon to do anything to her.","3":"But Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David’s brother; and Jonadab was a very clever man.","4":"And he said to him, “Why are you, the king’s son, so depressed morning after morning? Will you not tell me?” So Amnon said to him, “I am in love with Tamar, the sister of my brother Absalom.”","5":"Jonadab then said to him, “Lie down on your bed and pretend to be ill; when your father comes to see you, say to him, ‘Please have my sister Tamar come and give me food to eat, and have her prepare the food in my sight, so that I may see it and eat from her hand.’”","6":"So Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill; when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, “Please have my sister Tamar come and make me a couple of pastries in my sight, so that I may eat from her hand.”","7":"Then David sent a messenger to the house for Tamar, saying, “Go now to your brother Amnon’s house, and prepare food for him.”","8":"So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house, and he was lying in bed. And she took dough, kneaded it, made pastries in his sight, and baked the pastries.","9":"Then she took the tray and served them to him, but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, “Have everyone leave me.” So everyone left him.","10":"Then Amnon said to Tamar, “Bring the food into the bedroom, so that I may eat from your hand.” So Tamar took the pastries which she had made and brought them into the bedroom to her brother Amnon.","11":"When she brought them to him to eat, he took hold of her and said to her, “Come, sleep with me, my sister.”","12":"But she said to him, “No, my brother, do not violate me, for such a thing is not done in Israel; do not do this disgraceful sin!","13":"“As for me, where could I get rid of my shame? And as for you, you will be like one of the fools in Israel. Now then, please speak to the king, for he will not withhold me from you.”","14":"However, he would not listen to her; since he was stronger than she, he violated her and slept with her.","15":"Then Amnon hated her with a very great hatred; indeed, the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, “Get up, go away!”","16":"But she said to him, “No, because this wrong in sending me away is greater than the other that you have done to me!” Yet he would not listen to her.","17":"Then he called his young man who attended him and said, “Now throw this woman out of my presence, and lock the door behind her!”","18":"Now she had on a long-sleeved garment; for this is how the virgin daughters of the king dressed themselves in robes. Then his attendant took her out and locked the door behind her.","19":"Tamar took ashes and put them on her head, and tore her long-sleeved garment which was on her; and she put her hand on her head and went on her way, crying out as she went.","20":"Then Absalom her brother said to her, “Has Amnon your brother been with you? But now keep silent, my sister, he is your brother; do not take this matter to heart.” So Tamar remained and was isolated in her brother Absalom’s house.","21":"Now when King David heard about all these matters, he became very angry.","22":"But Absalom did not speak with Amnon either good or bad; for Absalom hated Amnon because he had violated his sister Tamar.","23":"Now it came about after two full years that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal-hazor, which is near Ephraim, and Absalom invited all the king’s sons to celebrate.","24":"And Absalom came to the king and said, “Behold now, your servant has sheepshearers; may the king and his servants please go with your servant.”","25":"But the king said to Absalom, “No, my son, we should not all go, so that we will not be a burden to you.” Though he urged him, he would not go; but he blessed him.","26":"Then Absalom said, “If not, please have my brother Amnon go with us.” But the king said to him, “Why should he go with you?”","27":"Nevertheless Absalom urged him, so he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him.","28":"Then Absalom commanded his servants, saying, “See now, when Amnon’s heart is cheerful with wine, and I say to you, ‘Strike Amnon,’ then put him to death. Do not fear; have I not commanded you myself? Be courageous and be valiant.”","29":"And the servants of Absalom did to Amnon just as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king’s sons got up and each mounted his mule and fled.","30":"Now it was while they were on the way that the report came to David, saying, “Absalom has struck and killed all the king’s sons, and not one of them is left.”","31":"Then the king stood up, tore his clothes, and lay on the ground; and all his servants were standing by with clothes torn.","32":"And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David’s brother, responded, “Let my lord not assume that they have put to death all the young men, the king’s sons, for only Amnon is dead; because this has been set up by the intent of Absalom since the day that he violated his sister Tamar.","33":"“So now, may my lord the king not take the report to heart, claiming, ‘all the king’s sons are dead’; but only Amnon is dead.”","34":"Now Absalom had fled. And the young man who was the watchman raised his eyes and looked, and behold, many people were coming from the road behind him by the side of the mountain.","35":"And Jonadab said to the king, “Behold, the king’s sons have come; so it has happened according to your servant’s word.”","36":"As soon as he had finished speaking, behold, the king’s sons came and raised their voices and wept; and the king and all his servants also wept very profusely.","37":"Now Absalom had fled and gone to Talmai the son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.","38":"So Absalom had fled and gone to Geshur, and was there for three years.","39":"And the heart of King David longed to go out to Absalom; for he was comforted regarding Amnon, since he was dead."},"14":{"1":"Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king’s heart was drawn toward Absalom.","2":"So Joab sent a messenger to Tekoa and brought a wise woman from there, and said to her, “Please follow mourning rites, and put on mourning garments now, and do not anoint yourself with oil but be like a woman who has been mourning for the dead for many days.","3":"Then go to the king and speak to him in this way.” So Joab put the words in her mouth.","4":"Now when the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground and prostrated herself, and said, “Help, O king!”","5":"And the king said to her, “What is troubling you?” And she answered, “Truly I am a widow, for my husband is dead.","6":"“And your servant had two sons, but the two of them fought in the field, and there was no one to save them from each other, so one struck the other and killed him.","7":"“Now behold, the entire family has risen against your servant, and they have said, ‘Hand over the one who struck his brother, so that we may put him to death for the life of his brother whom he killed, and eliminate the heir as well.’ So they will extinguish my coal which is left, so as to leave my husband neither name nor remnant on the face of the earth.”","8":"Then the king said to the woman, “Go to your home, and I will issue orders concerning you.”","9":"The woman of Tekoa said to the king, “My lord, the king, the guilt is on me and my father’s house, but the king and his throne are guiltless.”","10":"So the king said, “Whoever speaks to you, bring him to me, and he will not touch you anymore.”","11":"Then she said, “May the king please remember the LORD your God, so that the avenger of blood will not continue to destroy, otherwise they will destroy my son.” And he said, “As the LORD lives, not one hair of your son shall fall to the ground.”","12":"Then the woman said, “Please let your servant speak a word to my lord the king.” And he said, “Speak.”","13":"The woman said, “Why then have you planned such a thing against the people of God? For in speaking this word the king is like one who is guilty, in that the king does not bring back his banished one.","14":"“For we will surely die and are like water spilled on the ground, which cannot be gathered up. Yet God does not take away life, but makes plans so that the banished one will not be cast out from Him.","15":"“Now then, the reason I have come to speak this word to my lord the king is that the people have made me afraid; so your servant said, ‘Let me now speak to the king, perhaps the king will perform the request of his slave.","16":"‘For the king will listen, to save his slave from the hand of the man who would eliminate both me and my son from the inheritance of God.’","17":"“Then your servant said, ‘Please let the word of my lord the king be comforting, for as the angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and evil. And may the LORD your God be with you.’”","18":"Then the king answered and said to the woman, “Please do not hide anything from me that I am about to ask you.” And the woman said, “Let my lord the king please speak.”","19":"So the king said, “Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?” And the woman replied, “As your soul lives, my lord the king, no one can turn to the right or to the left from anything that my lord the king has spoken. Indeed, it was your servant Joab who commanded me, and it was he who put all these words in the mouth of your servant.","20":"“In order to change the appearance of things your servant Joab has done this thing. But my lord is wise, like the wisdom of the angel of God, to know all that is on the earth.”","21":"Then the king said to Joab, “Behold now, I will certainly do this thing; go then, bring back the young man Absalom.”","22":"And Joab fell on his face to the ground, prostrated himself, and blessed the king; then Joab said, “Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, my lord the king, in that the king has performed the request of his servant.”","23":"So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.","24":"However, the king said, “He shall return to his own house, but he shall not see my face.” So Absalom returned to his own house and did not see the king’s face.","25":"Now in all Israel there was no one as handsome as Absalom, so highly praised; from the sole of his foot to the top of his head there was no impairment in him.","26":"And when he cut the hair of his head (and it was at the end of every year that he cut it, because it was heavy on him, so he cut it), he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels by the king’s weight.","27":"And to Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter whose name was Tamar; she was a woman of beautiful appearance.","28":"Now Absalom lived two full years in Jerusalem, yet he did not see the king’s face.","29":"Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king, but he would not come to him. So he sent word again a second time, but he would not come.","30":"Therefore he said to his servants, “See, Joab’s plot is next to mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire.” So Absalom’s servants set the plot on fire.","31":"Then Joab got up, came to Absalom at his house, and said to him, “Why have your servants set my plot on fire?”","32":"Absalom answered Joab, “Behold, I sent for you, saying, ‘Come here, so that I may send you to the king, to say, “Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me still to be there.”’ Now then, let me see the king’s face, and if there is guilt in me, he can have me executed.”","33":"So when Joab came to the king and told him, he summoned Absalom. Then Absalom came to the king and prostrated himself with his face to the ground before the king; and the king kissed Absalom."},"15":{"1":"Now it came about after this that Absalom provided for himself a chariot and horses, and fifty men to run ahead of him.","2":"And Absalom used to rise early and stand beside the road to the gate; and when any man who had a lawsuit was to come before the king for judgment, Absalom would call out to him and say, “From what city are you?” And he would say, “Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel.”","3":"Then Absalom would say to him, “See, your claims are good and right, but you have no one to listen to you on the part of the king.”","4":"Moreover, Absalom would say, “Oh that someone would appoint me judge in the land, then every man who has a lawsuit or claim could come to me, and I would give him justice!”","5":"And whenever a man approached to prostrate himself before him, he would put out his hand and take hold of him and kiss him.","6":"Absalom dealt this way with all Israel who came to the king for judgment; so Absalom stole the hearts of the people of Israel.","7":"Now it came about at the end of four years that Absalom said to the king, “Please let me go and pay my vow which I have made to the LORD, in Hebron.","8":"“For your servant made a vow while I was living in Geshur in Aram, saying, ‘If the LORD will indeed bring me back to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.’”","9":"The king said to him, “Go in peace.” So he got up and went to Hebron.","10":"But Absalom sent spies throughout the tribes of Israel, saying, “As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then you shall say, ‘Absalom is king in Hebron!’”","11":"Then two hundred men went with Absalom from Jerusalem, who were invited and went innocently, for they did not know anything.","12":"And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counselor, from his city Giloh, while he was offering the sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong, for the people continually increased with Absalom.","13":"Then a messenger came to David, saying, “The hearts of the people of Israel are with Absalom.”","14":"So David said to all his servants who were with him in Jerusalem, “Arise and let’s flee, for otherwise none of us will escape from Absalom. Go quickly, or he will hurry and overtake us, and bring disaster on us and strike the city with the edge of the sword.”","15":"Then the king’s servants said to the king, “Behold, your servants will do whatever my lord the king chooses.”","16":"So the king left, and all his household with him; but the king left ten concubines behind to take care of the house.","17":"The king left, and all the people with him, and they stopped at the last house.","18":"Now all of his servants passed by beside him, and all the Cherethites, all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men who had come with him from Gath, passed by before the king.","19":"Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, “Why should you go with us too? Return and stay with your king, since you are a foreigner and an exile as well; return to your own place.","20":"“You came only yesterday, so should I make you wander with us today, while I go wherever I go? Return and take your brothers back; mercy and truth be with you.”","21":"But Ittai answered the king and said, “As the LORD lives, and as my lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king may be, whether for death or for life, there assuredly shall your servant be!”","22":"Then David said to Ittai, “Go and cross over the brook Kidron.” So Ittai the Gittite crossed over with all his men and all the little ones who were with him.","23":"While all the country was weeping with a loud voice, all the people were crossing over. The king was also crossing over the brook Kidron, and all the people were crossing over toward the way of the wilderness.","24":"Now behold, Zadok also came, and all the Levites with him, carrying the ark of the covenant of God. And they set down the ark of God, and Abiathar came up until all the people had finished crossing over from the city.","25":"And the king said to Zadok, “Return the ark of God to the city. If I find favor in the sight of the LORD, then He will bring me back and show me both it and His habitation.","26":"“But if He says this: ‘I have no delight in you,’ then here I am, let Him do to me as seems good to Him.”","27":"The king also said to Zadok the priest, “Are you not a seer? Return to the city in peace, and your two sons with you, your son Ahimaaz and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.","28":"“See, I am going to wait at the river crossing places of the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me.”","29":"So Zadok and Abiathar returned the ark of God to Jerusalem and remained there.","30":"And David was going up the ascent of the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went, and his head was covered, and he was walking barefoot. Then all the people who were with him each covered his own head, and they were going up, weeping as they went.","31":"Now someone informed David, saying, “Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.” And David said, “LORD, please make the advice of Ahithophel foolish.”","32":"It happened as David was coming to the summit, where God was worshiped, that behold, Hushai the Archite met him with his coat torn, and dust on his head.","33":"And David said to him, “If you go over with me, then you will become a burden to me.","34":"“But if you return to the city and say to Absalom, ‘I will be your servant, O king; even as I was your father’s servant in time past, so now I will also be your servant,’ then you can foil the advice of Ahithophel for me.","35":"“Are Zadok and Abiathar the priests not with you there? So it shall be that whatever you hear from the king’s house, you shall report to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.","36":"“Behold their two sons are there with them, Ahimaaz, Zadok’s son and Jonathan, Abiathar’s son; and by them you shall send me everything that you hear.”","37":"So Hushai, David’s friend, came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem."},"16":{"1":"Now when David had gone on a little beyond the summit, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him with a team of saddled donkeys, and on them were two hundred loaves of bread, a hundred cakes of raisins, a hundred summer fruits, and a jug of wine.","2":"And the king said to Ziba, “Why do you have these?” And Ziba said, “The donkeys are for the king’s household to ride, the bread and summer fruit are for the young men to eat, and the wine, for whoever is weary in the wilderness to drink.”","3":"Then the king said, “And where is your master’s son?” And Ziba said to the king, “Behold, he is staying in Jerusalem, for he said, ‘Today the house of Israel will restore the kingdom of my father to me.’”","4":"So the king said to Ziba, “Behold, all that belongs to Mephibosheth is yours.” And Ziba said, “I prostrate myself; may I find favor in your sight, my lord, the king!”","5":"When King David came to Bahurim, behold, a man was coming out from there from the family of the house of Saul, and his name was Shimei, the son of Gera; he was coming out, cursing as he came.","6":"He also threw stones at David and all the servants of King David; and all the people and all the warriors were on his right and on his left.","7":"This is what Shimei said when he cursed: “Go away, go away, you man of bloodshed and worthless man!","8":"“The LORD has brought back upon you all the bloodshed of the house of Saul, in whose place you have become king; and the LORD has handed the kingdom over to your son Absalom. And behold, you are caught in your own evil, for you are a man of bloodshed!”","9":"Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, “Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Now let me go over and cut off his head.”","10":"But the king said, “What business of mine is yours, you sons of Zeruiah? If he curses, and if the LORD has told him, ‘Curse David,’ then who should say, ‘Why have you done so?’”","11":"Then David said to Abishai and to all his servants, “Behold, my son who came out of my own body seeks my life; how much more now this Benjaminite? Leave him alone and let him curse, for the LORD has told him.","12":"“Perhaps the LORD will look on my misery and return good to me instead of his cursing this day.”","13":"So David and his men went on the road; and Shimei kept going on the hillside close beside him, and as he went he cursed and threw stones and dirt at him.","14":"And the king and all the people who were with him arrived exhausted, and he refreshed himself there.","15":"Then Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel, entered Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.","16":"Now it came about, when Hushai the Archite, David’s friend, came to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom, “Long live the king! Long live the king!”","17":"But Absalom said to Hushai, “Is this your loyalty to your friend? Why did you not go with your friend?”","18":"So Hushai said to Absalom, “No! For whomever the LORD, this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, his I shall be, and with him I shall remain.","19":"“Besides, whom should I serve? Should I not serve in the presence of his son? Just as I have served in your father’s presence, so I shall be in your presence.”","20":"Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, “Give your advice. What should we do?”","21":"Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Have relations with your father’s concubines, whom he has left behind to take care of the house; then all Israel will hear that you have made yourself repulsive to your father. The hands of all who are with you will also be strengthened.”","22":"So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof, and Absalom had relations with his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel.","23":"Now the advice of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, was taken as though one inquired of the word of God; so was all the advice of Ahithophel regarded by both David and Absalom."},"17":{"1":"Furthermore, Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Please let me choose twelve thousand men and let me set out and pursue David tonight.","2":"“And I will attack him while he is weary and exhausted and startle him, so that all the people who are with him will flee. Then I will strike and kill the king when he is alone,","3":"and I will bring all the people back to you. The return of everyone depends on the man whom you are seeking; then all the people will be at peace.”","4":"And the plan pleased Absalom and all the elders of Israel.","5":"Nevertheless, Absalom said, “Now call Hushai the Archite also, and let’s hear what he has to say.”","6":"When Hushai had come to Absalom, Absalom said to him, “Ahithophel has proposed this plan. Should we carry out his plan? If not, say so yourself.”","7":"So Hushai said to Absalom, “This time the advice that Ahithophel has given is not good.”","8":"Then Hushai said, “You yourself know your father and his men, that they are warriors and they are fierce, like a bear deprived of her cubs in the field. And your father is an expert in warfare, and he will not spend the night with the people.","9":"“Behold, he has now hidden himself in one of the ravines, or in another place; and it will be that when he falls on them at the first attack, whoever hears it will say, ‘There has been a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom!’","10":"“And even the one who is valiant, whose heart is like the heart of a lion, will completely despair; for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man, and those who are with him are valiant men.","11":"“But I advise that all Israel be fully gathered to you, from Dan even to Beersheba, like the sand that is by the sea in abundance; and that you personally go into battle.","12":"“Then we will come to him in one of the places where he can be found, and we will fall on him just as the dew falls on the ground; and of him and of all the men who are with him, not even one will be left.","13":"“And if he withdraws into a city, then all Israel shall bring ropes to that city, and we will drag it into the valley until not even a pebble is found there.”","14":"Then Absalom and all the men of Israel said, “The advice of Hushai the Archite is better than the advice of Ahithophel.” For the LORD had ordained to foil the good advice of Ahithophel, in order for the LORD to bring disaster on Absalom.","15":"Then Hushai said to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, “This is what Ahithophel advised Absalom and the elders of Israel to do, and this is what I have advised.","16":"“Now then, send a messenger quickly and tell David, saying, ‘Do not spend the night at the river crossing places of the wilderness, but by all means cross over, or else the king and all the people who are with him will be destroyed.’”","17":"Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying at En-rogel, and a female servant would go and inform them, and they would go and inform King David, for they could not allow themselves to be seen entering the city.","18":"But a boy did see them, and he told Absalom; so the two of them left quickly and came to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his courtyard, and they went down into it.","19":"And the woman took a cover and spread it over the well’s mouth and scattered barley meal on it, so that nothing was known.","20":"Then Absalom’s servants came to the woman at the house and said, “Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?” And the woman said to them, “They have crossed the brook of water.” And when they searched and did not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.","21":"It came about after they had departed, that they came up out of the well and went and reported to King David; and they said to David, “Set out and cross over the water quickly, because this is what Ahithophel has advised against you.”","22":"Then David and all the people who were with him set out and crossed the Jordan; by dawn not even one remained who had not crossed the Jordan.","23":"Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice had not been followed, he saddled his donkey and set out and went to his home, to his city, and set his house in order, and hanged himself; so he died and was buried in his father’s grave.","24":"Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom crossed the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.","25":"Absalom put Amasa in command of the army in place of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man whose name was Ithra the Israelite, who had relations with Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister of Zeruiah, Joab’s mother.","26":"And Israel and Absalom camped in the land of Gilead.","27":"Now when David had come to Mahanaim, Shobi the son of Nahash from Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, Machir the son of Ammiel from Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim,","28":"brought beds, basins, pottery, wheat, barley, flour, roasted grain, beans, lentils, roasted seeds,","29":"honey, curds, sheep, and cheese of the herd, for David and the people who were with him, to eat. For they said, “The people are hungry and exhausted and thirsty in the wilderness.”"},"18":{"1":"Then David took a count of the people who were with him and appointed over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds.","2":"And David sent the people out, a third under the command of Joab, a third under the command of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, and a third under the command of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said to the people, “I myself will certainly go out with you also.”","3":"But the people said, “You should not go out; for if in fact we flee, they will not care about us; and if half of us die, they will not care about us. But you are worth ten thousand of us; so now it is better that you will be ready to help us from the city.”","4":"Then the king said to them, “Whatever seems best to you I will do.” So the king stood beside the gate, and all the people went out by hundreds and thousands.","5":"But the king commanded Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, saying, “Deal gently with the young man Absalom for my sake.” And all the people heard when the king commanded all the commanders regarding Absalom.","6":"Then the people went out to the field against Israel, and the battle took place in the forest of Ephraim.","7":"The people of Israel were defeated there by the servants of David, and the slaughter there that day was great, twenty thousand men.","8":"For the battle there was spread over the whole countryside, and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.","9":"Now Absalom encountered the servants of David. Absalom was riding on his mule, and the mule went under the branches of a massive oak. Then his head caught firmly in the oak, and he was left hanging between the sky and earth, while the mule that was under him kept going.","10":"When a certain man saw him, he informed Joab and said, “Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak.”","11":"Then Joab said to the man who had informed him, “So behold, you saw him! Why then did you not strike him there to the ground? And it would have been my duty to give you ten pieces of silver and a belt.”","12":"But the man said to Joab, “Even if I were to receive a thousand pieces of silver in my hand, I would not put out my hand against the king’s son; for in our hearing the king commanded you, Abishai, and Ittai, saying, ‘Protect the young man Absalom for me!’","13":"“Otherwise, if I had dealt treacherously against his life (and there is nothing hidden from the king), then you yourself would have avoided me.”","14":"Then Joab said, “I will not waste time here with you.” So he took three spears in his hand and thrust them through the heart of Absalom while he was still alive in the midst of the oak.","15":"And ten young men who carried Joab’s armor gathered around and struck Absalom and killed him.","16":"Then Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing Israel, for Joab restrained the people.","17":"And they took Absalom and threw him into a deep pit in the forest, and erected over him a very large pile of stones. And all Israel fled, each to his own tent.","18":"Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and set up for himself a memorial stone, which is in the King’s Valley, for he said, “I have no son to continue my name.” So he named the memorial stone after his own name, and it is called Absalom’s Monument to this day.","19":"Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, “Please let me run and bring the king news that the LORD has freed him from the hand of his enemies!”","20":"But Joab said to him, “You are not the man to bring news this day, but you shall bring news another day; however, you shall bring no news this day, because the king’s son is dead.”","21":"Then Joab said to the Cushite, “Go, tell the king what you have seen.” So the Cushite bowed to Joab and ran.","22":"However, Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said once more to Joab, “But whatever happens, please let me also run after the Cushite.” And Joab said, “Why would you run, my son, since you will have no messenger’s reward for going?”","23":"“But whatever happens,” he said, “I will run.” So he said to him, “Run.” Then Ahimaaz ran by way of the plain and passed by the Cushite.","24":"Now David was sitting between the two gates; and the watchman went to the roof of the gate by the wall, and raised his eyes and looked; and behold, a man was running by himself.","25":"So the watchman called out and told the king. And the king said, “If he is by himself there is good news in his mouth.” And he came nearer and nearer.","26":"Then the watchman saw another man running; and the watchman called to the gatekeeper and said, “Behold, another man is running by himself.” And the king said, “This one also is bringing good news.”","27":"The watchman said, “I think the running form of the first one is like the running form of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok.” And the king said, “This is a good man, and he is coming with good news.”","28":"Then Ahimaaz called out and said to the king, “All is well.” And he prostrated himself before the king with his face to the ground. And he said, “Blessed is the LORD your God, who has turned over the men who raised their hands against my lord the king.”","29":"But the king said, “Is it well with the young man Absalom?” And Ahimaaz answered, “When Joab sent the king’s servant, and your servant, I saw a great commotion, but I did not know what it was.”","30":"Then the king said, “Turn aside and stand here.” So he turned aside and stood still.","31":"Then behold, the Cushite arrived, and the Cushite said, “Let my lord the king receive good news, for the LORD has freed you this day from the hand of all those who rose up against you.”","32":"Then the king said to the Cushite, “Is it well with the young man Absalom?” And the Cushite answered, “May the enemies of my lord the king, and all who rise up against you for evil, be like that young man!”","33":"Then the king trembled and went up to the chamber over the gate and wept. And this is what he said as he walked: “My son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you, Absalom, my son, my son!”"},"19":{"1":"Then it was reported to Joab, “Behold, the king is weeping and he mourns for Absalom.”","2":"So the victory that day was turned into mourning for all the people, because the people heard it said that day, “The king is in mourning over his son.”","3":"And the people entered the city surreptitiously that day, just as people who are humiliated surreptitiously flee in battle.","4":"And the king covered his face and cried out with a loud voice, “My son Absalom, Absalom, my son, my son!”","5":"Then Joab came into the house to the king and said, “Today you have shamed all your servants, who have saved your life today and the lives of your sons and daughters, the lives of your wives, and the lives of your concubines,","6":"by loving those who hate you, and by hating those who love you. For you have revealed today that commanders and servants are nothing to you; for I know today that if Absalom were alive and all of us were dead today, then it would be right as far as you are concerned.","7":"“Now therefore arise, go out and speak kindly to your servants, for I swear by the LORD, if you do not go out, no man will stay the night with you, and this will be worse for you than all the misfortune that has happened to you from your youth until now!”","8":"So the king got up and sat at the gate. When they told all the people, saying, “Behold, the king is sitting at the gate,” then all the people came before the king.\nNow Israel had fled, each to his tent.","9":"And all the people were quarreling throughout the tribes of Israel, saying, “The king rescued us from the hands of our enemies and saved us from the hands of the Philistines, but now he has fled out of the land from Absalom.","10":"“However, Absalom, whom we anointed over us, has died in battle. Now then, why are you silent about bringing the king back?”","11":"Then King David sent word to Zadok and Abiathar the priests, saying, “Speak to the elders of Judah, saying, ‘Why are you the last to bring the king back to his house, since the word of all Israel has come to the king, even to his house?","12":"‘You are my brothers; you are my bone and my flesh. Why then should you be the last to bring back the king?’","13":"“And say to Amasa, ‘Are you not my bone and my flesh? May God do so to me, and more so, if you will not be commander of the army for me continually, in place of Joab.’”","14":"So he turned the hearts of all the men of Judah as one man, so that they sent word to the king, saying, “Return, you and all your servants.”","15":"The king then returned and came as far as the Jordan. And the men of Judah came to Gilgal in order to go to meet the king, to escort the king across the Jordan.","16":"Then Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjaminite who was from Bahurim, hurried and came down with the men of Judah to meet King David.","17":"And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they rushed to the Jordan before the king.","18":"Then they crossed the shallow places repeatedly to bring over the king’s household, and to do what was good in his sight. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king as he was about to cross the Jordan.","19":"And he said to the king, “May my lord not consider me guilty, nor call to mind what your servant did wrong on the day when my lord the king went out from Jerusalem, so that the king would take it to heart.","20":"“For your servant knows that I have sinned; so behold, I have come today, the first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.”","21":"But Abishai the son of Zeruiah responded, “Should Shimei not be put to death for this, the fact that he cursed the LORD’S anointed?”","22":"David then said, “What is there between you and me, you sons of Zeruiah, that you should be an adversary to me today? Should anyone be put to death in Israel today? For do I not know that I am king over Israel today?”","23":"So the king said to Shimei, “You shall not die.” The king also swore to him.","24":"Then Mephibosheth the grandson of Saul came down to meet the king; but he had neither tended to his feet, nor trimmed his mustache, nor washed his clothes since the day the king departed until the day he came home in peace.","25":"And it was when he came from Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said to him, “Why did you not go with me, Mephibosheth?”","26":"So he said, “My lord the king, my servant betrayed me; for your servant said, ‘I will saddle the donkey for myself so that I may ride on it and go with the king,’ since your servant cannot walk.","27":"“Furthermore, he has slandered your servant to my lord the king; but my lord the king is like the angel of God, therefore do what is good in your sight.","28":"“For all my father’s household was only people worthy of death to my lord the king; yet you placed your servant among those who ate at your own table. So what right do I still have, that I should complain anymore to the king?”","29":"So the king said to him, “Why do you still speak of your affairs? I have decided, ‘You and Ziba shall divide the land.’”","30":"And Mephibosheth said to the king, “Let him even take it all, since my lord the king has come safely to his own house.”","31":"Now Barzillai the Gileadite had come down from Rogelim; and he went on to the Jordan with the king to escort him over the Jordan.","32":"Barzillai was very old: eighty years old; and he had provided the king food while he stayed in Mahanaim, for he was a very great man.","33":"So the king said to Barzillai, “You cross over with me, and I will provide you food in Jerusalem with me.”","34":"But Barzillai said to the king, “How long do I still have to live, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?","35":"“I am now eighty years old. Can I distinguish between good and bad? Or can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink? Or can I still hear the voice of men and women singing? Why then should your servant be an added burden to my lord the king?","36":"“Your servant would merely cross over the Jordan with the king. So why should the king compensate me with this reward?","37":"“Please let your servant return, so that I may die in my own city near the grave of my father and my mother. However, here is your servant Chimham; let him cross over with my lord the king, and do for him what is good in your sight.”","38":"And the king answered, “Chimham shall cross over with me, and I will do for him what is good in your sight; and whatever you require of me, I will do for you.”","39":"All the people crossed over the Jordan and the king crossed too. The king then kissed Barzillai and blessed him, and he returned to his place.","40":"Now the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him; and all the people of Judah and also half the people of Israel accompanied the king.","41":"And behold, all the men of Israel came to the king and said to the king, “Why have our brothers, the men of Judah, abducted you and brought the king and his household and all David’s men with him, over the Jordan?”","42":"Then all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, “Because the king is a close relative to us. Why then are you angry about this matter? Have we eaten at all at the king’s expense, or has anything been taken for us?”","43":"But the men of Israel answered the men of Judah and said, “We have ten parts in the king, therefore we also have more claim on David than you. Why then did you treat us with contempt? Was it not our advice first to bring back our king?” Yet the words of the men of Judah were harsher than the words of the men of Israel."},"20":{"1":"Now a worthless man happened to be there whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjaminite; and he blew the trumpet and said,\n“We have no share in David,\nNor do we have an inheritance in the son of Jesse;\nEvery man to his tents, Israel!”","2":"So all the men of Israel withdrew from following David and followed Sheba the son of Bichri; but the men of Judah remained loyal to their king, from the Jordan even to Jerusalem.","3":"Then David came to his house in Jerusalem, and the king took the ten women, the concubines whom he had left behind to take care of the house, and put them in custody and provided them with food, but did not have relations with them. So they were locked up until the day of their death, living as widows.","4":"Now the king said to Amasa, “Summon the men of Judah for me within three days, and be present here yourself.”","5":"So Amasa went to summon the men of Judah, but he was delayed longer than the set time which he had designated for him.","6":"And David said to Abishai, “Now Sheba the son of Bichri will do us more harm than Absalom; take your lord’s servants and pursue him, so that he does not find for himself fortified cities and escape from our sight.”","7":"So Joab’s men went out after him, along with the Cherethites, the Pelethites, and all the warriors; and they left Jerusalem to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri.","8":"When they were at the large stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Now Joab was dressed in his military attire, and over it he had a belt with a sword in its sheath strapped on at his waist; and as he went forward, it fell out.","9":"And Joab said to Amasa, “Is it going well for you, my brother?” And Joab took hold of Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him.","10":"But Amasa was not on guard against the sword which was in Joab’s hand, so he struck him in the belly with it and spilled out his intestines on the ground, and did not strike him again, and he died. Then Joab and his brother Abishai pursued Sheba the son of Bichri.","11":"Now one of Joab’s young men stood by him and said, “Whoever favors Joab and whoever is for David, follow Joab!”","12":"But Amasa was wallowing in his own blood in the middle of the road. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa from the road to the field and threw a garment over him when he saw that everyone who came by him stood still.","13":"As soon as he was removed from the road, all the men went on after Joab to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri.","14":"Now he went on through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, that is, Beth-maacah, and all the Berites; and they assembled and went after him as well.","15":"And they came and besieged him in Abel Beth-maacah, and they built up an assault ramp against the city, and it stood against the outer rampart; and all the people who were with Joab were wreaking destruction in order to topple the wall.","16":"Then a wise woman called out from the city, “Listen, listen! Please tell Joab, ‘Come here that I may speak with you.’”","17":"So he approached her, and the woman said, “Are you Joab?” And he answered, “I am.” Then she said to him, “Listen to the words of your slave.” And he said, “I am listening.”","18":"Then she spoke, saying, “In the past they used to say, ‘They will undoubtedly ask advice at Abel,’ and that is how they ended a dispute.","19":"“I am one of those who are ready for peace and faithful in Israel. You are trying to destroy a city, even a mother in Israel. Why would you swallow up the inheritance of the LORD?”","20":"Joab replied, “Far be it, far be it from me that I would consume or destroy!","21":"“Such is not the case. But a man from the hill country of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, has raised his hand against King David. Only turn him over, and I will depart from the city.” And the woman said to Joab, “Behold, his head will be thrown to you over the wall.”","22":"Then the woman wisely came to all the people. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri and threw it to Joab. So he blew the trumpet, and they were dispersed from the city, each to his tent. Joab also returned to the king at Jerusalem.","23":"Now Joab was in command of the entire army of Israel, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites;","24":"and Adoram was over the forced labor, and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the secretary;","25":"and Sheva was scribe, and Zadok and Abiathar were priests;","26":"Ira the Jairite also was a priest to David."},"21":{"1":"Now there was a famine in the days of David for three years, year after year; and David sought the presence of the LORD. And the LORD said, “It is because of Saul and his bloody house, because he put the Gibeonites to death.”","2":"So the king called the Gibeonites and spoke to them (now the Gibeonites were not of the sons of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites, and the sons of Israel had made a covenant with them, but Saul had sought to kill them in his zeal for the sons of Israel and Judah).","3":"David said to the Gibeonites, “What should I do for you? And how can I make amends, so that you will bless the inheritance of the LORD?”","4":"Then the Gibeonites said to him, “For us it is not a matter of silver or gold with Saul or his house, nor is it for us to put anyone to death in Israel.” Nevertheless David said, “I will do for you whatever you say.”","5":"So they said to the king, “The man who destroyed us and who planned to eliminate us so that we would not exist within any border of Israel—","6":"let seven men from his sons be given to us, and we will hang them before the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of the LORD.” And the king said, “I will give them.”","7":"But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, because of the oath of the LORD which was between them, between David and Saul’s son Jonathan.","8":"So the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, Armoni and Mephibosheth whom she had borne to Saul, and the five sons of Merab the daughter of Saul, whom she had borne to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite.","9":"Then he handed them over to the Gibeonites, and they hanged them on the mountain before the LORD, so that the seven of them fell together; and they were put to death in the first days of harvest at the beginning of barley harvest.","10":"And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it out for herself on the rock, from the beginning of harvest until it rained on them from the sky; and she allowed neither the birds of the sky to rest on them by day nor the wild animals by night.","11":"When it was reported to David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done,","12":"then David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of his son Jonathan from the citizens of Jabesh-gilead, who had stolen them from the public square of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hanged them on the day the Philistines struck and killed Saul in Gilboa.","13":"He brought up from there the bones of Saul and the bones of his son Jonathan, and they gathered the bones of those who had been hanged.","14":"Then they buried the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan in the country of Benjamin in Zela, in the grave of his father Kish; so they did everything that the king commanded, and after that God responded to prayer for the land.","15":"Now when the Philistines were at war with Israel again, David went down, and his servants with him; and when they fought against the Philistines, David became weary.","16":"Then Ishbi-benob, who was among the descendants of the giant, the weight of whose spear was three hundred shekels of bronze in weight, had strapped on a new sword, and he intended to kill David.","17":"But Abishai the son of Zeruiah helped him, and struck the Philistine and killed him. Then David’s men swore to him, saying, “You shall not go out again with us to battle, so that you do not extinguish the lamp of Israel.”","18":"Now it came about after this that there was war again with the Philistines at Gob; then Sibbecai the Hushathite struck and killed Saph, who was among the descendants of the giant.","19":"And there was war with the Philistines again at Gob, and Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim the Bethlehemite killed Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.","20":"And there was war at Gath again, where there was a man of great stature who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in number; and he also had been born to the giant.","21":"When he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimei, David’s brother, struck and killed him.","22":"These four were born to the giant at Gath, and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants."},"22":{"1":"Now David spoke the words of this song to the LORD on the day that the LORD had saved him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul.","2":"He said,\n“The LORD is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer;","3":"My God, my rock, in

So Israel will become a saying and an object of derision among all peoples.","8":"“And this house will become a heap of ruins; everyone who passes by it will be appalled and hiss and say, ‘Why has the LORD done such a thing to this land and this house?’","9":"“And they will say, ‘Because they abandoned the LORD their God, who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and they adopted other gods and worshiped and served them, for that reason the LORD has brought all this adversity on them.’”","10":"Now it came about at the end of twenty years in which Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD and the king’s house","11":"(Hiram king of Tyre had supplied Solomon with cedar and juniper timber and gold, satisfying all his desire), that King Solomon then gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.","12":"So Hiram left Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him, and they did not please him.","13":"And he said, “What are these cities which you have given me, my brother?” So they have been called the land of Cabul to this day.","14":"And Hiram sent to the king 120 talents of gold.","15":"Now this is the account of the forced labor which King Solomon conscripted to build the house of the LORD, his own house, the Millo, the wall of Jerusalem, Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer.","16":"For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up and overthrown Gezer and burned it with fire, and killed the Canaanites who lived in the city; and he had given it as a dowry to his daughter, Solomon’s wife.","17":"So Solomon rebuilt Gezer and the lower Beth-horon,","18":"and Baalath and Tamar in the wilderness, in the land of Judah,","19":"and all the storage cities which Solomon had, that is, the cities for his chariots and the cities for his horsemen, and everything that it pleased Solomon to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land under his rule.","20":"As for all the people who were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of the sons of Israel,","21":"their descendants who were left after them in the land, whom the sons of Israel were unable to completely eliminate, from them Solomon conscripted forced laborers, as they are to this day.","22":"But Solomon did not make slaves of the sons of Israel; for they were men of war, his servants, his commanders, his charioteers, his chariot commanders, and his horsemen.","23":"These were the chief officers who were in charge of Solomon’s work, 550, who ruled over the people doing the work.","24":"As soon as Pharaoh’s daughter came up from the city of David to her house which Solomon had built for her, he then built the Millo.","25":"Now three times a year Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar which he had built for the LORD, burning incense with them on the altar which was before the LORD. So he finished the house.","26":"King Solomon also built a fleet of ships in Ezion-geber, which is near Eloth on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.","27":"And Hiram sent his servants with the fleet, sailors who knew the sea, along with the servants of Solomon.","28":"And they went to Ophir and received 420 talents of gold from there, and brought it to King Solomon."},"10":{"1":"Now when the queen of Sheba heard about the fame of Solomon in relation to the name of the LORD, she came to test him with riddles.","2":"So she came to Jerusalem with a very large entourage, with camels carrying balsam oil and a very large quantity of gold and precious stones.

And behold, the half of it was not reported to me. You have exceeded in wisdom and prosperity the report which I heard.","8":"“Blessed are your men, and blessed are these servants of yours who stand before you continually and hear your wisdom!","9":"“Blessed be the LORD your God who delighted in you to put you on the throne of Israel; because the LORD loves Israel forever, He made you king, to do justice and righteousness.”","10":"Then she gave the king 120 talents of gold, and a very large amount of balsam oil and precious stones. Never again did such a large quantity of balsam oil come in as that which the queen of Sheba gave King Solomon.","11":"And the ships of Hiram as well, which brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir a very great number of almug trees and precious stones.","12":"The king made from the almug trees supports for the house of the LORD and for the king’s house, and lyres and harps for the singers; such almug trees have not come in again, nor have they been seen to this day.","13":"And King Solomon granted the queen of Sheba everything she desired, whatever she requested, besides what he gave her in proportion to his royal bounty. Then she departed and went to her own land together with her servants.","14":"Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was 666 talents of gold,","15":"besides that from the traders, and the wares of the merchants and all the kings of the Arabs and the governors of the country.","16":"King Solomon made two hundred large shields of beaten gold, using six hundred shekels of gold on each large shield.","17":"And he made three hundred small shields of beaten gold, using three minas of gold on each shield; and the king put them in the house of the timber of Lebanon.","18":"Moreover, the king made a large throne of ivory and overlaid it with fine gold.","19":"There were six steps to the throne and a round top to the throne at its back, and armrests on each side of the seat, and two lions standing beside the armrests.","20":"Twelve lions were standing there on the six steps on the one side and on the other; nothing like it was made for any other kingdom.","21":"Now all King Solomon’s drinking utensils were of gold, and all the utensils of the house of the timber of Lebanon were of pure gold. None was of silver; it was not considered as amounting to anything in the days of Solomon.","22":"For the king had the ships of Tarshish at sea with Hiram’s ships; once every three years the ships of Tarshish would come carrying gold and silver, ivory, monkeys, and peacocks.","23":"So King Solomon became greater than all the kings of the earth in wealth and wisdom.","24":"And all the earth was seeking the attention of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.","25":"And they were bringing, everyone, a gift: articles of silver and gold, garments, weapons, balsam oil, horses, and mules, so much year by year.","26":"Now Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen; and he had 1,400 chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, and he stationed them in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.","27":"And the king made silver as common as stones in Jerusalem, and he made cedars as plentiful as sycamore trees that are in the lowland.","28":"Also Solomon’s import of horses was from Egypt and Kue, and the king’s merchants acquired them from Kue for a price.","29":"A chariot was imported from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for 150;

they will certainly turn your heart away to follow their gods.” Solomon clung to these in love.","3":"He had seven hundred wives, who were princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned his heart away.","4":"For when Solomon was old, his wives turned his heart away to follow other gods; and his heart was not wholly devoted to the LORD his God, as the heart of his father David had been.","5":"For Solomon became a follower of Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and of Milcom the abhorrent idol of the Ammonites.","6":"So Solomon did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and did not follow the LORD fully, as his father David had done.","7":"Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh, the abhorrent idol of Moab, on the mountain that is east of Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abhorrent idol of the sons of Ammon.","8":"He also did the same for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and sacrificed to their gods.","9":"Now the LORD was angry with Solomon because his heart had turned away from the LORD, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice,","10":"and had commanded him regarding this thing, that he was not to follow other gods; but he did not comply with what the LORD had commanded.","11":"So the LORD said to Solomon, “Since you have done this, and you have not kept My covenant and My statutes, which I have commanded you, I will certainly tear the kingdom away from you, and will give it to your servant.","12":"“However, I will not do it in your days, only for the sake of your father David; but I will tear it away from the hand of your son.","13":"“Yet I will not tear away all the kingdom, but I will give one tribe to your son for the sake of My servant David, and for the sake of Jerusalem, which I have chosen.”","14":"Then the LORD raised up an adversary against Solomon, Hadad the Edomite; he was of the royal line in Edom.","15":"For it came about, when David was in Edom and Joab the commander of the army had gone up to bury those killed in battle, and had struck and killed every male in Edom","16":"(for Joab and all Israel stayed there for six months, until he had eliminated every male in Edom),","17":"that Hadad fled to Egypt, he and certain Edomites of his father’s servants with him, while Hadad was a young boy.","18":"They set out from Midian and came to Paran; and they took men with them from Paran and came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house and assigned him food and gave him land.","19":"Now Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him in marriage the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.","20":"And the sister of Tahpenes gave birth to his son Genubath, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh’s house; and Genubath was in Pharaoh’s house among the sons of Pharaoh.","21":"But when Hadad heard in Egypt that David lay down with his fathers and that Joab the commander of the army was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, “Let me go, so that I may go to my own country.”","22":"However, Pharaoh said to him, “But what have you lacked with me that you are here, requesting to go to your own country?” And he answered, “Nothing; nevertheless you must let me go.”","23":"God also raised up another adversary against him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his master Hadadezer, king of Zobah.","24":"And he gathered men to himself and became leader of a marauding band, after David killed those of Zobah; and they went to Damascus and stayed there, and reigned in Damascus.","25":"So he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, along with the harm that Hadad inflicted; and he felt disgust for Israel and reigned over Aram.","26":"Then Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, Solomon’s servant, whose mother’s name was Zeruah, a widow, also rebelled against the king.","27":"Now this was the reason why he rebelled against the king: Solomon built the Millo, and closed up the breach of the city of his father David.","28":"Now the man Jeroboam was a valiant warrior, and when Solomon saw that the young man was industrious, he appointed him over all the forced labor of the house of Joseph.","29":"And it came about at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him on the road. Now Ahijah had clothed himself with a new cloak; and both of them were alone in the field.","30":"Then Ahijah took hold of the new cloak which was on him and tore it into twelve pieces.","31":"And he said to Jeroboam, “Take for yourself ten pieces; for this is what the LORD, the God of Israel says: ‘Behold, I am going to tear the kingdom away from the hand of Solomon and give you ten tribes","32":"(but he shall have one tribe, for the sake of My servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel),","33":"because they have abandoned Me, and have worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the sons of Ammon; and they have not walked in My ways, doing what is right in My sight and keeping My statutes and My ordinances, as his father David did.","34":"‘Nevertheless I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand, but I will make him ruler all the days of his life, for the sake of My servant David whom I chose, who kept My commandments and My statutes;","35":"but I will take the kingdom from his son’s hand and give it to you; that is, ten tribes.","36":"‘But to his son I will give one tribe, so that My servant David may always have a lamp before Me in Jerusalem, the city where I have chosen for Myself to put My name.","37":"‘However I will take you, and you shall reign over all that you desire, and you shall be king over Israel.","38":"‘Then it shall be, that if you listen to all that I command you and walk in My ways, and do what is right in My sight by keeping My statutes and My commandments, as My servant David did, then I will be with you and build you an enduring house as I built for David, and I will give Israel to you.","39":"‘So I will oppress the descendants of David for this, but not always.’”","40":"Solomon sought therefore to put Jeroboam to death; but Jeroboam set out and fled to Egypt to Shishak king of Egypt, and he was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.","41":"Now the rest of the acts of Solomon and whatever he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the Book of the Acts of Solomon?","42":"So the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.","43":"Then Solomon lay down with his fathers and was buried in the city of his father David, and his son Rehoboam reigned in his place."},"12":{"1":"Then Rehoboam went to Shechem, because all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king.","2":"Now when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard about this, he was living in Egypt (for he was still in Egypt, where he had fled from the presence of King Solomon).","3":"Then they sent word and summoned him, and Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,","4":"“Your father made our yoke hard; but now, lighten the hard labor imposed by your father and his heavy yoke which he put on us, and we will serve you.”","5":"Then he said to them, “Depart for three days, then return to me.” So the people departed.","6":"And King Rehoboam consulted with the elders who had served his father Solomon while he was still alive, saying, “How do you advise me to answer this people?”","7":"Then they spoke to him, saying, “If you will be a servant to this people today, and will serve them and grant them their request, and speak pleasant words to them, then they will be your servants always.”","8":"But he ignored the advice of the elders which they had given him, and consulted with the young men who had grown up with him and served him.","9":"He said to them, “What advice do you give, so that we may answer this people who have spoken to me, saying, ‘Lighten the yoke which your father put on us’?”","10":"And the young men who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, “This is what you should say to this people who spoke to you, saying: ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, now you make it lighter for us!’ You should speak this way to them: ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s waist!","11":"‘Now then, my father loaded you with a heavy yoke; yet I will add to your yoke. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions!’”","12":"Then Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, just as the king had directed, saying, “Return to me on the third day.”","13":"And the king answered the people harshly, for he ignored the advice of the elders which they had given him,","14":"and he spoke to them according to the advice of the young men, saying, “My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke; my father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions!”","15":"So the king did not listen to the people; because it was a turn of events from the LORD, in order to establish His word which the LORD spoke through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.","16":"When all Israel saw that the king had not listened to them, the people replied to the king, saying,\n“What share do we have in David?\nWe have no inheritance in the son of Jesse;\nTo your tents, Israel!\nNow look after your own house, David!”\nSo Israel went away to their tents.","17":"But as for the sons of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.","18":"Then King Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was in charge of the forced labor, and all Israel stoned him to death. And King Rehoboam hurried to mount his chariot to flee to Jerusalem.","19":"So Israel has broken with the house of David to this day.","20":"And it came about, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned, that they sent word and called him to the assembly, and made him king over all Israel. None except the tribe of Judah alone followed the house of David.","21":"Now when Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin, 180,000 chosen warriors, to fight against the house of Israel to restore the kingdom to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.","22":"But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,","23":"“Tell Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and the rest of the people, saying,","24":"‘This is what the LORD says: “You shall not go up nor fight against your relatives the sons of Israel; return, every man to his house, for this thing has come from Me.”’” So they listened to the word of the LORD, and returned to go their way in accordance with the word of the LORD.","25":"Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and lived there. And he went out from there and built Penuel.","26":"And Jeroboam said in his heart, “Now the kingdom will return to the house of David.","27":"“If this people go up to offer sacrifices in the house of the LORD in Jerusalem, then the heart of this people will return to their lord, to Rehoboam king of Judah; and they will kill me and return to Rehoboam king of Judah.”","28":"So the king consulted, and he made two golden calves; and he said to the people, “It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem; behold your gods, Israel, that brought you up from the land of Egypt.”","29":"And he set up one in Bethel, and the other he put in Dan.","30":"Now this thing became a sin, for the people went to worship before the one as far as Dan.","31":"And he made houses on high places, and appointed priests from all the people who were not of the sons of Levi.","32":"Jeroboam also instituted a feast in the eighth month on the fifteenth day of the month, like the feast that is in Judah, and he went up to the altar. So he did in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves which he had made. And he stationed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made.","33":"Then he went up to the altar which he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, the month that he had devised in his own heart; and he instituted a feast for the sons of Israel and went up to the altar to burn incense."},"13":{"1":"Now behold, a man of God came from Judah to Bethel by the word of the LORD, while Jeroboam was standing at the altar to burn incense.","2":"And he cried out against the altar by the word of the LORD and said, “Altar, altar, this is what the LORD says: ‘Behold, a son shall be born to the house of David, Josiah by name; and on you he shall sacrifice the priests of the high places who burn incense on you, and human bones shall burn on you.’”","3":"Then he gave a sign on the same day, saying, “This is the sign which the LORD has spoken: ‘Behold, the altar shall be torn to pieces and the ashes which are on it shall be poured out.’”","4":"Now when the king heard the statement of the man of God which he cried out against the altar in Bethel, Jeroboam stretched out his hand from the altar, saying, “Seize him!” But his hand which he had stretched out toward him dried up, and he could not draw it back to himself.","5":"The altar also was torn to pieces and the ashes were poured out from the altar, in accordance with the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the LORD.","6":"And the king responded and said to the man of God, “Please appease the LORD your God and pray for me, so that my hand may be restored to me.” So the man of God appeased the LORD, and the king’s hand was restored to him, and it became as it was before.","7":"Then the king said to the man of God, “Come home with me and refresh yourself, and I will give you a gift.”","8":"But the man of God said to the king, “If you were to give me half your house, I would not go with you, nor would I eat bread or drink water in this place.","9":"“For so it was commanded me by the word of the LORD, saying, ‘You shall not eat bread nor drink water, nor return by the way that you came.’”","10":"So he went another way and did not return by the way that he had come to Bethel.","11":"Now an old prophet was living in Bethel; and his sons came and told him all the deeds which the man of God had done that day in Bethel; the words which he had spoken to the king, these also they reported to their father.","12":"And their father said to them, “Which way did he go?” Now his sons had seen the way that the man of God who came from Judah had gone.","13":"Then he said to his sons, “Saddle the donkey for me.” So they saddled the donkey for him and he rode away on it.","14":"So he went after the man of God and found him sitting under an oak; and he said to him, “Are you the man of God who came from Judah?” And he said, “I am.”","15":"Then he said to him, “Come home with me and eat bread.”","16":"But he said, “I cannot return with you, nor come with you, nor will I eat bread or drink water with you in this place.","17":"“For a command came to me by the word of the LORD: ‘You shall not eat bread, nor drink water there; do not return by going the way that you came.’”","18":"Then he said to him, “I too am a prophet like you, and an angel spoke to me by the word of the LORD, saying, ‘Bring him back with you to your house, so that he may eat bread and drink water.’” But he lied to him.","19":"So he went back with him, and ate bread in his house and drank water.","20":"Now it came about, as they were sitting down at the table, that the word of the LORD came to the prophet who had brought him back;","21":"and he cried out to the man of God who came from Judah, saying, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Because you have disobeyed the command of the LORD, and have not kept the commandment which the LORD your God commanded you,","22":"but have returned and eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which He said to you, “You are not to eat bread nor drink water”; your dead body will not come to the grave of your fathers.’”","23":"It came about after he had eaten bread and after he had drunk, that he saddled the donkey for him, for the prophet whom he had brought back.","24":"Now when he had gone, a lion met him on the way and killed him, and his body was thrown on the road, with the donkey standing beside it; the lion also was standing beside the body.","25":"And behold, men passed by and saw the body thrown on the road, and the lion standing beside the body; so they came and told about it in the city where the old prophet had lived.","26":"Now when the prophet who had brought him back from the way heard about it, he said, “It is the man of God, who disobeyed the command of the LORD; therefore the LORD has given him to the lion, which has torn him and killed him, in accordance with the word of the LORD which He spoke to him.”","27":"Then he spoke to his sons, saying, “Saddle the donkey for me.” And they saddled it.","28":"Then he went and found his body thrown on the road, with the donkey and the lion standing beside the body; the lion had not eaten the body nor harmed the donkey.","29":"So the prophet picked up the body of the man of God and laid it on the donkey and brought it back; and he came to the city of the old prophet to mourn and to bury him.","30":"He laid his body in his own grave, and they mourned over him, saying, “Oh, my brother!”","31":"And after he had buried him, he talked to his sons, saying, “When I die, bury me in the grave in which the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones.","32":"“For the thing will certainly come to pass which he cried out by the word of the LORD against the altar that is in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria.”","33":"After this event, Jeroboam did not abandon his evil way, but he again appointed priests of the high places from all the people; anyone who wanted, he ordained, and he became one of the priests of the high places.","34":"This event also became a sin of the house of Jeroboam, even to wipe it out and eliminate it from the face of the earth."},"14":{"1":"At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam became sick.","2":"And Jeroboam said to his wife, “Now arise and disguise yourself so that they will not know that you are the wife of Jeroboam, and go to Shiloh.

He will tell you what will happen to the boy.”","4":"And Jeroboam’s wife did so, and set out and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. Now Ahijah could not see because his eyes were glossy from his old age.","5":"Now the LORD had said to Ahijah, “Behold, the wife of Jeroboam is coming to inquire of you about her son, because he is sick. You shall say such and such to her, for it will be when she arrives, that she is going to make herself unrecognizable.”","6":"So when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet coming in the doorway, he said, “Come in, wife of Jeroboam; why do you make yourself unrecognizable? Nevertheless, I am sent to you with a harsh message.","7":"“Go, say to Jeroboam, ‘This is what the LORD, the God of Israel says: “Because I exalted you from among the people and made you leader over My people Israel,","8":"and tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you—yet you have not been like My servant David, who kept My commandments and followed Me with all his heart, to do only that which was right in My sight;","9":"you also have done more evil than all who were before you, and you have gone and made for yourself other gods and cast metal images to provoke Me to anger, and have thrown Me behind your back—","10":"therefore behold, I am bringing disaster on the house of Jeroboam, and I will eliminate from Jeroboam every male person, both bond and free in Israel, and I will make a clean sweep of the house of Jeroboam, just as one sweeps away dung until it is all gone.","11":"“Anyone belonging to Jeroboam who dies in the city, the dogs will eat.

Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned for seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen from all the tribes of Israel to put His name there. And his mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess.","22":"And the people of Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked Him to jealousy with their sins which they committed, more than all that their fathers had done.","23":"For they, too, built for themselves high places, memorial stones, and Asherim on every high hill and under every luxuriant tree.","24":"There were also male cult prostitutes in the land. They committed all the same abominations of the nations which the LORD dispossessed before the sons of Israel.","25":"Now it happened in the fifth year of King Rehoboam, that Shishak the king of Egypt marched against Jerusalem.","26":"And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king’s house, and he took everything; he even took all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.","27":"So King Rehoboam made shields of bronze in their place, and entrusted them to the care of the commanders of the guard who guarded the doorway of the king’s house.","28":"And it happened as often as the king entered the house of the LORD, that the guards would carry them and would bring them back into the guards’ room.","29":"Now as for the rest of the acts of Rehoboam and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?","30":"And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.","31":"And Rehoboam lay down with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David; and his mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess. And his son Abijam became king in his place."},"15":{"1":"Now in the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, Abijam became king over Judah.","2":"He reigned for three years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.","3":"He walked in all the sins of his father which he had committed before him; and his heart was not wholly devoted to the LORD his God, like the heart of his father David.","4":"But for David’s sake the LORD his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, to raise up his son after him and to establish Jerusalem,","5":"because David did what was right in the sight of the LORD, and did not deviate from anything that He commanded him all the days of his life, except in the case of Uriah the Hittite.","6":"And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.","7":"Now as for the rest of the acts of Abijam and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.","8":"And Abijam lay down with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David; and his son Asa became king in his place.","9":"So in the twentieth year of Jeroboam the king of Israel, Asa began to reign as king of Judah.","10":"He reigned for forty-one years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.","11":"Now Asa did what was right in the sight of the LORD, like his father David.","12":"He also removed the male cult prostitutes from the land and removed all the idols which his fathers had made.","13":"And even his mother Maacah, he also removed her from the position of queen mother, because she had made an abominable image as an Asherah; and Asa cut down her abominable image and burned it at the brook Kidron.","14":"But the high places were not eliminated; nevertheless Asa’s heart was wholly devoted to the LORD all his days.","15":"And he brought into the house of the LORD the holy gifts of his father and his own holy gifts: silver, gold, and valuable utensils.","16":"Now there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.","17":"Baasha king of Israel marched against Judah and fortified Ramah in order to prevent anyone from going out or coming in to Asa king of Judah.","18":"Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that was left in the treasuries of the house of the LORD and the treasuries of the king’s house, and handed it over to his servants. And King Asa sent them to Ben-hadad the son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, king of Aram, who lived in Damascus, saying,","19":"“Let’s make a treaty between you and me, as there was between my father and your father. Behold, I have sent you a gift of silver and gold; go, break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel so that he will withdraw from me.”","20":"So Ben-hadad listened to King Asa and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel, and conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel-beth-maacah, and all Chinneroth, besides all the land of Naphtali.","21":"When Baasha heard about it, he stopped fortifying Ramah and remained in Tirzah.","22":"Then King Asa made a proclamation to all Judah—no one was exempt—and they carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber with which Baasha had built fortifications. And King Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin and Mizpah.","23":"Now as for the rest of all the acts of Asa and all his might, and all that he did and the cities which he built, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? But in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet.","24":"And Asa lay down with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of his father David; and his son Jehoshaphat reigned in his place.","25":"Now Nadab the son of Jeroboam became king over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and he reigned over Israel for two years.","26":"He did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father and in his sin into which he misled Israel.","27":"Then Baasha the son of Ahijah of the house of Issachar conspired against him, and Baasha struck and killed him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines, while Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to Gibbethon.","28":"So Baasha killed him in the third year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his place.","29":"And as soon as he was king, he struck and killed all the household of Jeroboam. He did not leave Jeroboam any persons alive, but kept killing until he had eliminated them, in accordance with the word of the LORD which He spoke by His servant Ahijah the Shilonite,","30":"and because of the sins of Jeroboam which he committed, and into which he misled Israel, because of his provocation with which he provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger.","31":"Now as for the rest of the acts of Nadab and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?","32":"And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.","33":"In the third year of Asa king of Judah, Baasha the son of Ahijah became king over all Israel at Tirzah, and he reigned for twenty-four years.","34":"And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of Jeroboam and in his sin into which he misled Israel."},"16":{"1":"Now the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying,","2":"“Since I exalted you from the dust and made you leader over My people Israel, and you have walked in the way of Jeroboam and have misled My people Israel into sin, provoking Me to anger with their sins,","3":"behold, I am going to burn Baasha and his house, and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.","4":"“Anyone belonging to Baasha who dies in the city, the dogs will eat; and anyone belonging to him who dies in the field, the birds of the sky will eat.”","5":"Now as for the rest of the acts of Baasha and what he did and his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?","6":"And Baasha lay down with his fathers and was buried in Tirzah, and his son Elah became king in his place.","7":"Moreover, the word of the LORD through the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came against Baasha and his household, both because of all the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD, provoking Him to anger with the work of his hands, by being like the house of Jeroboam, and because he struck it.","8":"In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah the son of Baasha became king over Israel at Tirzah, and reigned for two years.","9":"And his servant Zimri, commander of half his chariots, conspired against him. Now Elah was in Tirzah drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, who was in charge of the household in Tirzah.","10":"Then Zimri came in and struck him and put him to death in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and he became king in his place.","11":"And when he became king, as soon as he sat on his throne, he killed all the household of Baasha; he did not leave a single male alive, either of his relatives or of his friends.","12":"So Zimri eliminated all the household of Baasha, in accordance with the word of the LORD which He spoke against Baasha through Jehu the prophet,","13":"for all the sins of Baasha and the sins of his son Elah, which they committed and into which they misled Israel, provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their idols.","14":"Now as for the rest of the acts of Elah and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?","15":"In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, Zimri reigned for seven days in Tirzah. Now the people were camped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.","16":"And the people who were camped heard it being said, “Zimri has conspired and has also struck and killed the king!” Therefore all Israel made Omri, the commander of the army, king over Israel that day in the camp.","17":"Then Omri and all Israel with him went up from Gibbethon and besieged Tirzah.","18":"When Zimri saw that the city was taken, he went into the citadel of the king’s house and burned the king’s house over himself with fire, and died,","19":"because of his sins which he committed, doing evil in the sight of the LORD, walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he committed, misleading Israel into sin.","20":"Now as for the rest of the acts of Zimri and his conspiracy which he carried out, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?","21":"Then the people of Israel were divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; the other half followed Omri.","22":"But the people who followed Omri prevailed over the people who followed Tibni the son of Ginath. And Tibni died and Omri became king.","23":"In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah, Omri became king over Israel and reigned for twelve years; he reigned for six years at Tirzah.","24":"And he purchased the hill Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver; and he built on the hill, and named the city which he built Samaria, after the name of Shemer, the owner of the hill.","25":"Now Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD, and acted more wickedly than all who were before him.","26":"For he walked entirely in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and in his sins into which he misled Israel, provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their idols.","27":"Now as for the rest of the acts of Omri which he did and his might which he displayed, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?","28":"And Omri lay down with his fathers and was buried in Samaria; and his son Ahab became king in his place.","29":"Now Ahab the son of Omri became king over Israel in the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah, and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria for twenty-two years.","30":"Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD more than all who were before him.","31":"And as though it had been a trivial thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, he married Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshiped him.","32":"So he erected an altar for Baal at the house of Baal, which he built in Samaria.","33":"Ahab also made the Asherah. So Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before him.","34":"In his days Hiel the Bethelite rebuilt Jericho; he laid its foundations with the loss of Abiram his firstborn, and set up its gates with the loss of his youngest son Segub, in accordance with the word of the LORD, which He spoke by Joshua the son of Nun."},"17":{"1":"Now Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the settlers of Gilead, said to Ahab, “As the LORD, the God of Israel lives, before whom I stand, there shall certainly be neither dew nor rain during these years, except by my word.”","2":"Then the word of the LORD came to him, saying,","3":"“Go away from here and turn eastward, and hide yourself by the brook Cherith, which is east of the Jordan.","4":"“And it shall be that you will drink from the brook, and I have commanded the ravens to provide food for you there.”","5":"So he went and did everything according to the word of the LORD, for he went and lived by the brook Cherith, which is east of the Jordan.","6":"And the ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning and bread and meat in the evening, and he would drink from the brook.","7":"But it happened after a while that the brook dried up, because there was no rain in the land.","8":"Then the word of the LORD came to him, saying,","9":"“Arise, go to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and stay there; behold, I have commanded a widow there to provide food for you.”","10":"So he arose and went to Zarephath, and when he came to the entrance of the city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks; and he called to her and said, “Please get me a little water in a cup, so that I may drink.”","11":"As she was going to get it, he called to her and said, “Please bring me a piece of bread in your hand.”","12":"But she said, “As the LORD your God lives, I have no food, only a handful of flour in the bowl and a little oil in the jar; and behold, I am gathering a few sticks so that I may go in and prepare it for me and my son, so that we may eat it and die.”","13":"However, Elijah said to her, “Do not fear; go, do as you have said. Just make me a little bread loaf from it first and bring it out to me, and afterward you may make one for yourself and for your son.","14":"“For this is what the LORD, the God of Israel says: ‘The bowl of flour shall not be used up, nor shall the jar of oil become empty, until the day that the LORD provides rain on the face of the earth.’”","15":"So she went and did everything in accordance with the word of Elijah, and she and he and her household ate for many days.","16":"The bowl of flour was not used up, nor did the jar of oil become empty, in accordance with the word of the LORD which He spoke through Elijah.","17":"Now it happened after these things that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, became sick; and his condition became very grave, until at the end he was no longer breathing.","18":"So she said to Elijah, “Why is my business any of yours, you man of God? Yet you have come to me to bring my wrongdoing to remembrance, and to put my son to death!”","19":"But he said to her, “Give me your son.” Then he took him from her arms and carried him up to the upstairs room where he was living, and laid him on his own bed.","20":"And he called to the LORD and said, “LORD, my God, have You also brought catastrophe upon the widow with whom I am staying, by causing her son to die?”","21":"Then he stretched himself out over the boy three times, and called to the LORD and said, “LORD, my God, please, let this boy’s life return to him.”","22":"And the LORD listened to the voice of Elijah, and the life of the boy returned to him and he revived.","23":"Elijah then took the boy and brought him down from the upstairs room into the house and gave him to his mother; and Elijah said, “See, your son is alive.”","24":"Then the woman said to Elijah, “Now I know that you are a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in your mouth is truth.”"},"18":{"1":"Now it happened after many days that the word of the LORD came to Elijah in the third year, saying, “Go, present yourself to Ahab, and I will provide rain on the face of the earth.”","2":"So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab. Now the famine was severe in Samaria.","3":"Ahab summoned Obadiah, who was in charge of the household. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly;","4":"for when Jezebel killed the prophets of the LORD, Obadiah took a hundred prophets and hid them by fifties in a cave, and provided them with bread and water.)","5":"Then Ahab said to Obadiah, “Go through the land to all the springs of water and to all the river valleys; perhaps we will find grass and keep the horses and mules alive, and not have to kill some of the cattle.”","6":"So they divided the land between them to survey it; Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.","7":"Now as Obadiah was on the way, behold, Elijah met him, and he recognized him and fell on his face and said, “Is it you, Elijah my master?”","8":"And he said to him, “It is I. Go, say to your master, ‘Behold, Elijah is here.’”","9":"But he said, “What sin have I committed, that you are handing your servant over to Ahab, to put me to death?","10":"“As surely as the LORD your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom to which my master has not sent word to search for you; and whenever they say, ‘He is not here,’ he makes the kingdom or nation swear that they could not find you.","11":"“Yet now you are saying, ‘Go, say to your master, “Behold, Elijah is here!”’","12":"“And it will come about when I leave you that the Spirit of the LORD will carry you to where I do not know; so when I come and inform Ahab and he cannot find you, he will kill me, though I, your servant, have feared the LORD from my youth.","13":"“Has it not been reported to my master what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of the LORD, that I hid a hundred prophets of the LORD by fifties in a cave, and provided them with bread and water?","14":"“Yet now you are saying, ‘Go, say to your master, “Behold, Elijah is here”’; he will then kill me!”","15":"Then Elijah said, “As surely as the LORD of armies lives, before whom I stand, I will certainly present myself to him today.”","16":"So Obadiah went to meet Ahab and informed him; then Ahab went to meet Elijah.","17":"When Ahab saw Elijah, Ahab said to him, “Is this you, the cause of disaster to Israel?”","18":"He said, “I have not brought disaster to Israel, but you and your father’s house have, because you have abandoned the commandments of the LORD and you have followed the Baals.","19":"“Now then, send orders and gather to me all Israel at Mount Carmel, together with 450 prophets of Baal and four hundred prophets of the Asherah, who eat at Jezebel’s table.”","20":"So Ahab sent orders among all the sons of Israel and brought the prophets together at Mount Carmel.","21":"Then Elijah approached all the people and said, “How long are you going to struggle with the two choices? If the LORD is God, follow Him; but if Baal, follow him.” But the people did not answer him so much as a word.","22":"Then Elijah said to the people, “I alone am left as a prophet of the LORD, while Baal’s prophets are 450 men.","23":"“Now have them give us two oxen; and have them choose the one ox for themselves and cut it up, and place it on the wood, but put no fire under it; and I will prepare the other ox and lay it on the wood, and I will not put a fire under it.","24":"“Then you call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of the LORD; and the God who answers by fire, He is God.” And all the people replied, “That is a good idea.”","25":"So Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, “Choose the one ox for yourselves and prepare it first, since there are many of you, and call on the name of your god, but put no fire under the ox.”","26":"Then they took the ox which was given them and they prepared it, and they called on the name of Baal from morning until noon, saying, “O Baal, answer us!” But there was no voice and no one answered. And they limped about the altar which they had made.","27":"And at noon Elijah ridiculed them and said, “Call out with a loud voice, since he is a god; undoubtedly he is attending to business, or is on the way, or is on a journey. Perhaps he is asleep, and will awaken.”","28":"So they cried out with a loud voice, and cut themselves according to their custom with swords and lances until blood gushed out on them.","29":"When midday was past, they raved until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice; but there was no voice, no one answered, and no one paid attention.","30":"Then Elijah said to all the people, “Come forward to me.” So all the people came forward to him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD which had been torn down.","31":"Then Elijah took twelve stones, corresponding to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD had come, saying, “Israel shall be your name.”","32":"And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD; and he made a trench around the altar, large enough to hold two measures of seed.","33":"Then he laid out the wood, and he cut the ox in pieces and placed it on the wood.","34":"And he said, “Fill four large jars with water and pour it on the burnt offering and on the wood.” And he said, “Do it a second time,” so they did it a second time. Then he said, “Do it a third time,” so they did it a third time.","35":"The water flowed around the altar, and he also filled the trench with water.","36":"Then at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, Elijah the prophet approached and said, “LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, today let it be known that You are God in Israel and that I am Your servant, and that I have done all these things at Your word.","37":"“Answer me, LORD, answer me, so that this people may know that You, LORD, are God, and that You have turned their heart back.”","38":"Then the fire of the LORD fell and consumed the burnt offering and the wood, and the stones and the dust; and it licked up the water that was in the trench.","39":"When all the people saw this, they fell on their faces; and they said, “The LORD, He is God; the LORD, He is God!”","40":"Then Elijah said to them, “Seize the prophets of Baal; do not let one of them escape.” So they seized them; and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slaughtered them there.","41":"Now Elijah said to Ahab, “Go up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of the roar of a heavy shower.”","42":"So Ahab went up to eat and drink. But Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he bent down to the earth and put his face between his knees.","43":"And he said to his servant, “Go up now, look toward the sea.” So he went up and looked, but he said, “There is nothing.” Yet Elijah said, “Go back” seven times.","44":"And when he returned the seventh time, he said, “Behold, a cloud as small as a person’s hand is coming up from the sea.” And Elijah said, “Go up, say to Ahab, ‘Harness your chariot horses and go down, so that the heavy shower does not stop you.’”","45":"Meanwhile the sky became dark with clouds and wind came up, and there was a heavy shower. And Ahab rode and went to Jezreel.","46":"Then the hand of the LORD was on Elijah, and he belted his cloak around his waist and outran Ahab to Jezreel."},"19":{"1":"Now Ahab told Jezebel everything that Elijah had done, and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword.","2":"Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, “So may the gods do to me and more so, if by about this time tomorrow I do not make your life like the life of one of them.”","3":"And he was afraid, and got up and ran for his life and came to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah; and he left his servant there.","4":"But he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a broom tree; and he asked for himself to die, and said, “Enough! Now, LORD, take my life, for I am no better than my fathers.”","5":"Then he lay down and fell asleep under a broom tree; but behold, there was an angel touching him, and he said to him, “Arise, eat!”","6":"And he looked, and behold, there was at his head a round loaf of bread baked on hot coals, and a pitcher of water. So he ate and drank, and lay down again.","7":"But the angel of the LORD came back a second time and touched him, and said, “Arise, eat; because the journey is too long for you.”","8":"So he arose and ate and drank, and he journeyed in the strength of that food for forty days and forty nights to Horeb, the mountain of God.","9":"Then he came there to a cave and spent the night there; and behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and He said to him, “What are you doing here, Elijah?”","10":"And he said, “I have been very zealous for the LORD, the God of armies; for the sons of Israel have abandoned Your covenant, torn down Your altars, and killed Your prophets with the sword. And I alone am left; and they have sought to take my life.”","11":"So He said, “Go out and stand on the mountain before the LORD.” And behold, the LORD was passing by! And a great and powerful wind was tearing out the mountains and breaking the rocks in pieces before the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind. And after the wind there was an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake.","12":"And after the earthquake, a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire; and after the fire, a sound of a gentle blowing.","13":"When Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his cloak and went out and stood in the entrance of the cave. And behold, a voice came to him and said, “What are you doing here, Elijah?”","14":"Then he said, “I have been very zealous for the LORD, the God of armies; for the sons of Israel have abandoned Your covenant, torn down Your altars, and killed Your prophets with the sword. And I alone am left; and they have sought to take my life.”","15":"The LORD said to him, “Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus; and when you have arrived, you shall anoint Hazael king over Aram.","16":"You shall also anoint Jehu the son of Nimshi king over Israel; and you shall anoint Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah as prophet in your place.","17":"“And it shall come about that the one who escapes from the sword of Hazael, Jehu shall put to death, and the one who escapes from the sword of Jehu, Elisha shall put to death.","18":"“Yet I will leave seven thousand in Israel, all the knees that have not bowed to Baal and every mouth that has not kissed him.”","19":"So he departed from there and found Elisha the son of Shaphat while he was plowing, with twelve yoke of oxen in front of him, and he with the twelfth. And Elijah came over to him and threw his cloak on him.","20":"Then he left the oxen behind and ran after Elijah, and said, “Please let me kiss my father and my mother, then I will follow you.” And he said to him, “Go back, for what have I done to you?”","21":"So he returned from following him, and took the pair of oxen and sacrificed them, and cooked their meat with the implements of the oxen, and gave it to the people and they ate. Then he got up and followed Elijah and served him."},"20":{"1":"Now Ben-hadad, king of Aram, gathered all his army, and there were thirty-two kings with him, and horses and chariots. And he went up and besieged Samaria, and fought against it.","2":"Then he sent messengers to the city to Ahab, king of Israel, and said to him, “This is what Ben-hadad says:","3":"‘Your silver and your gold are mine; your most beautiful wives and children are also mine.’”","4":"And the king of Israel replied, “As you say, my lord, O king; I am yours, as well as all that I have.”","5":"Then the messengers returned and said, “Ben-hadad says this: ‘I did indeed send word to you, saying, “You shall give me your silver, your gold, your wives, and your children”;","6":"but about this time tomorrow I will send my servants to you, and they will search your house and the houses of your servants; and they will take in their hands everything that is pleasing to your eyes, and take it all away.’”","7":"Then the king of Israel summoned all the elders of the land and said, “Please be aware and see that this man is looking for trouble; for he sent me his demand for my wives, my children, my silver, and my gold, and I did not refuse him.”","8":"Then all the elders and all the people said to him, “Do not listen nor consent.”","9":"So he said to the messengers of Ben-hadad, “Tell my lord the king, ‘Everything that you sent as a demand to your servant at the first, I will do; but this thing I cannot do.’” Then the messengers departed, and brought him word again.","10":"Ben-hadad sent word to him and said, “May the gods do so to me and more so, if the dust of Samaria will be enough for handfuls for all the people who follow me.”","11":"Then the king of Israel replied, “Tell him, ‘He who straps on his weapons had better not boast like one who takes them off.’”","12":"And when Ben-hadad heard this message, while he was drinking with the kings in the temporary shelters, he said to his servants, “Take your positions.” So they took their positions against the city.","13":"Now behold, a prophet approached Ahab king of Israel, and said, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Have you seen all this great multitude? Behold, I am going to hand them over to you today, and you shall know that I am the LORD.’”","14":"But Ahab said, “By whom?” So he said, “The LORD says this: ‘By the young men of the leaders of the provinces.’” Then he said, “Who will begin the battle?” And he said, “You will.”","15":"So he mustered the young men of the leaders of the provinces, and there were 232; and after them he mustered all the people, all the sons of Israel: seven thousand.","16":"They went out at noon, while Ben-hadad was drinking himself drunk in the temporary shelters with the thirty-two kings who were helping him.","17":"The young men of the leaders of the provinces went out first; and Ben-hadad sent out scouts, and they reported to him, saying, “Men have come out from Samaria.”","18":"Then he said, “If they have come out for peace, take them alive; or if they have come out for war, take them alive as well.”","19":"So these men went out from the city, the young men of the leaders of the provinces, and the army which followed them.","20":"And they killed, each one, his man; and the Arameans fled and Israel pursued them, and Ben-hadad the king of Aram escaped on a horse with horsemen.","21":"The king of Israel also went out and struck the horses and chariots, and killed the Arameans in a great slaughter.","22":"Then the prophet approached the king of Israel and said to him, “Go, show yourself courageous and be aware and see what you have to do; for at the turn of the year the king of Aram will march against you.”","23":"Now the servants of the king of Aram said to him, “Their gods are gods of the mountains; for that reason they were stronger than we.

Then we will fight against them in the plain, and we will certainly be stronger than they.” And he listened to their voice and did so.","26":"So at the turn of the year Ben-hadad mustered the Arameans and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel.","27":"And the sons of Israel were mustered and given provisions, and they went to meet them; and the sons of Israel camped opposite them like two little flocks of goats, while the Arameans filled the country.","28":"Then a man of God approached and spoke to the king of Israel, and said, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Since the Arameans have said, “The LORD is a god of mountains, but He is not a god of valleys,” therefore I will hand over to you all this great multitude, and you shall know that I am the LORD.’”","29":"So they camped, one opposite the other, for seven days. And on the seventh day the battle was joined, and the sons of Israel killed of the Arameans a hundred thousand foot soldiers in a single day.","30":"But the rest fled to Aphek into the city, and the wall fell on twenty-seven thousand men who were left. And Ben-hadad fled and came into the city, going from one inner room to another.","31":"But his servants said to him, “Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings. Please let’s put sackcloth around our waists and ropes on our heads, and go out to the king of Israel; perhaps he will let you live.”","32":"So they put sackcloth around their waists and ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel and said, “Your servant Ben-hadad says, ‘Please let me live.’” And Ahab said, “Is he still alive? He is my brother.”","33":"Now the men took this as a good omen, and quickly accepting it from him, they said, “Your brother Ben-hadad.” Then he said, “Go, bring him.” Then Ben-hadad came out to him, and he had him mount the chariot.","34":"And Ben-hadad said to him, “The cities which my father took from your father I will restore, and you can make streets for yourself in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria.” Ahab said, “And I will let you go with this covenant.” So he made a covenant with him and let him go.","35":"Now a man from the sons of the prophets said to another by the word of the LORD, “Please strike me.” But the man refused to strike him.","36":"Then he said to him, “Because you have not listened to the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as you leave me, a lion will kill you.” And as soon as he left him a lion found him and killed him.","37":"Then he found another man and said, “Please strike me.” And the man struck him, injuring him.","38":"So the prophet departed and waited for the king by the road, and disguised himself with a bandage over his eyes.","39":"And as the king passed by, he cried out to the king and said, “Your servant went out into the midst of the battle; and behold, a man turned aside and brought a man to me and said, ‘Guard this man; if for any reason he goes missing, then your life shall be forfeited in place of his life, or else you shall pay a talent of silver.’","40":"“Now while your servant was busy here and there, he disappeared.” And the king of Israel said to him, “So shall your judgment be; you yourself determined it.”","41":"Then he quickly took the bandage away from his eyes, and the king of Israel recognized him, that he was one of the prophets.","42":"And the prophet said to him, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Since you have let go from your hand the man I had designated for destruction, your life shall be forfeited in place of his life, and your people in place of his people.’”","43":"So the king of Israel went to his house sullen and furious, and came to Samaria."},"21":{"1":"Now it came about after these things that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard which was in Jezreel beside the palace of Ahab, the king of Samaria.","2":"And Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, “Give me your vineyard so that I may have it for a vegetable garden, because it is close beside my house, and I will give you a better vineyard in place of it; if you prefer, I will give you what it is worth in money.”","3":"But Naboth said to Ahab, “The LORD forbid me that I would give you the inheritance of my fathers!”","4":"So Ahab entered his house sullen and furious because of the answer that Naboth the Jezreelite had given to him, since he said, “I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers.” And he lay down on his bed and turned his face away, and ate no food.","5":"But Jezebel his wife came to him and said to him, “How is it that your spirit is so sullen that you are not eating food?”","6":"So he said to her, “It is because I was speaking to Naboth the Jezreelite and saying to him, ‘Give me your vineyard for money; or else, if it pleases you, I will give you a vineyard in place of it.’ But he said, ‘I will not give you my vineyard.’”","7":"Jezebel his wife said to him, “Do you now reign over Israel? Arise, eat bread, and let your heart be joyful; I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.”","8":"So she wrote letters in Ahab’s name and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters to the elders and to the nobles who were living with Naboth in his city.","9":"Now she had written in the letters, saying, “Proclaim a fast and seat Naboth at the head of the people;","10":"and seat two worthless men opposite him, and have them testify against him, saying, ‘You cursed God and the king.’ Then take him out and stone him to death.”","11":"So the men of his city, the elders and the nobles who lived in his city, did just as Jezebel had sent word to them, just as it was written in the letters which she had sent them.","12":"They proclaimed a fast, and seated Naboth at the head of the people.","13":"Then the two worthless men came in and sat opposite him; and the worthless men testified against him, against Naboth, before the people, saying, “Naboth cursed God and the king.” So they took him outside the city and stoned him to death with stones.","14":"Then they sent word to Jezebel, saying, “Naboth has been stoned and is dead.”","15":"And when Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, Jezebel said to Ahab, “Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth, the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.”","16":"When Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, Ahab got up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.","17":"Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,","18":"“Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who is in Samaria; behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, where he has gone down to take possession of it.","19":"“And you shall speak to him, saying, ‘This is what the LORD says: “Have you murdered and also taken possession?”’ And you shall speak to him, saying, ‘The LORD says this: “In the place where the dogs licked up the blood of Naboth, the dogs will lick up your blood, yours as well.”’”","20":"Then Ahab said to Elijah, “Have you found me, enemy of mine?” And he answered, “I have found you, because you have given yourself over to do evil in the sight of the LORD.","21":"“Behold, I am bringing disaster upon you, and I will utterly sweep you away, and will eliminate from Ahab every male, both bond and free in Israel;","22":"and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, because of the provocation with which you have provoked Me to anger, and because you have misled Israel into sin.","23":"“The LORD has also spoken of Jezebel, saying, ‘The dogs will eat Jezebel in the territory of Jezreel.’","24":"“The one belonging to Ahab, who dies in the city, the dogs will eat; and the one who dies in the field, the birds of the sky will eat.”","25":"There certainly was no one like Ahab who gave himself over to do evil in the sight of the LORD, because Jezebel his wife incited him.","26":"He also acted very despicably in following idols, conforming to everything that the Amorites had done, whom the LORD drove out from the sons of Israel.","27":"Yet it came about, when Ahab heard these words, that he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and fasted, and he lay in sackcloth and went about despondently.","28":"Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,","29":"“Do you see how Ahab has humbled himself before Me?

Would you like me to speak for you to the king or to the commander of the army?’” But she answered, “I live among my own people.”","14":"So he said, “What then is to be done for her?” And Gehazi answered, “It is a fact that she has no son, and her husband is old.”","15":"He then said, “Call her.” When he had called her, she stood in the doorway.","16":"Then he said, “At this season next year, you are going to embrace a son.” And she said, “No, my lord, you man of God, do not lie to your servant.”","17":"Now the woman conceived and gave birth to a son at that season the next year, as Elisha had told her.","18":"When the child was grown, the day came that he went out to his father, to the reapers.","19":"And he said to his father, “My head, my head!” And his father said to his servant, “Carry him to his mother.”","20":"When he had carried him and brought him to his mother, he sat on her lap until noon, and then he died.","21":"And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door behind him and left.","22":"Then she called to her husband and said, “Please send me one of the servants and one of the donkeys, so that I may run to the man of God and return.”","23":"But he said, “Why are you going to him today? It is neither new moon nor Sabbath.” So she just said, “It will be fine.”","24":"Then she saddled the donkey and said to her servant, “Drive the donkey and go on; do not slow down the pace for me unless I tell you.”","25":"So she went on and came to the man of God at Mount Carmel.\nWhen the man of God saw her at a distance, he said to Gehazi his servant, “Behold, that person there is the Shunammite.","26":"“Please run now to meet her and say to her, ‘Is it going well for you? Is it going well for your husband? Is it going well for the child?’” Then she answered, “It is going well.”","27":"But she came to the man of God at the hill and took hold of his feet. And Gehazi came up to push her away, but the man of God said, “Leave her alone, for her soul is troubled within her; and the LORD has concealed it from me and has not informed me.”","28":"Then she said, “Did I ask for a son from my lord? Did I not say, ‘Do not give me false hope’?”","29":"Then he said to Gehazi, “Get ready and take my staff in your hand, and go; if you meet anyone, do not greet him, and if anyone greets you, do not reply to him. And lay my staff on the boy’s face.”","30":"The mother of the boy said, “As surely as the LORD lives and you yourself live, I will not leave you.” So he got up and followed her.","31":"Then Gehazi went on ahead of them and laid the staff on the boy’s face, but there was no sound or response. So he returned to meet him and informed him, saying, “The boy has not awakened.”","32":"When Elisha entered the house, behold the boy was dead, laid on his bed.","33":"So he entered and shut the door behind them both, and he prayed to the LORD.","34":"Then he got up on the bed and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth, his eyes on his eyes, his hands on his hands, and he bent down on him; and the flesh of the child became warm.","35":"Then he returned and walked in the house back and forth once, and went up and bent down on him; and the boy sneezed seven times, then the boy opened his eyes.","36":"And he called Gehazi and said, “Call this Shunammite.” So he called her. And when she came to him, he said, “Pick up your son.”","37":"Then she came in and fell at his feet and bowed down to the ground, and she picked up her son and left.","38":"When Elisha returned to Gilgal, there was a famine in the land. As the sons of the prophets were sitting in front of him, he said to his servant, “Put on the large pot and boil stew for the sons of the prophets.”","39":"Then one went out into the field to gather mallow, and found a wild vine and gathered from it his lap full of wild gourds; and he came and sliced them into the pot of stew, because they did not know what they were.","40":"So they poured it out for the men to eat. But as they were eating the stew, they cried out and said, “You man of God, there is death in the pot!” And they were unable to eat.","41":"Then he said, “Bring flour.” And he threw it into the pot, and said, “Pour it out for the people that they may eat.” Then there was nothing harmful in the pot.","42":"Now a man came from Baal-shalishah, and brought the man of God bread of the first fruits, twenty loaves of barley and fresh grain in his sack. And Elisha said, “Give them to the people that they may eat.”","43":"But his attendant said, “How am I to serve this to a hundred men?” Nevertheless he said, “Give them to the people that they may eat, for this is what the LORD says: ‘They shall eat and have some left over.’”","44":"So he served it to them, and they ate and had some left over, in accordance with the word of the LORD."},"5":{"1":"Now Naaman, commander of the army of the king of Aram, was a great man in the view of his master, and eminent, because by him the LORD had given victory to Aram. The man was also a valiant warrior, but afflicted with leprosy.","2":"Now the Arameans had gone out in bands and had taken captive a little girl from the land of Israel; and she waited on Naaman’s wife.","3":"And she said to her mistress, “If only my master were with the prophet who is in Samaria! Then he would cure him of his leprosy.”","4":"And Naaman went in and told his master, saying, “The girl who is from the land of Israel spoke such and such.”","5":"Then the king of Aram said, “Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel.” So he departed and took with him ten talents of silver, six thousand shekels of gold, and ten changes of clothes.","6":"And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, which said, “And now as this letter comes to you, behold, I have sent Naaman my servant to you, so that you may cure him of his leprosy.”","7":"But when the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes and said, “Am I God, to kill and to keep alive, that this man is sending word to me to cure a man of his leprosy? But consider now, and see how he is seeking a quarrel against me.”","8":"Now it happened, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, that he sent word to the king, saying, “Why did you tear your clothes? Just have him come to me, and he shall learn that there is a prophet in Israel.”","9":"So Naaman came with his horses and his chariots, and stood at the doorway of Elisha’s house.","10":"And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, “Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh will be restored to you and you will be clean.”","11":"But Naaman was furious and went away, and he said, “Behold, I thought, ‘He will certainly come out to me, and stand and call on the name of the LORD his God, and wave his hand over the site and cure the leprosy.’","12":"“Are Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, not better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them and be clean?” So he turned and went away in a rage.","13":"Then his servants approached and spoke to him, saying, “My father, had the prophet told you to do some great thing, would you not have done it? How much more then, when he says to you, ‘Wash, and be clean’?”","14":"So he went down and dipped himself in the Jordan seven times, in accordance with the word of the man of God; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.","15":"Then he returned to the man of God with all his company, and came and stood before him. And he said, “Behold now, I know that there is no God in all the earth, except in Israel; so please accept a gift from your servant now.”","16":"But he said, “As surely as the LORD lives, before whom I stand, I will accept nothing.” And he urged him to accept it, but he refused.","17":"Then Naaman said, “If not, please let your servant be given two mules’ load of earth; for your servant will no longer offer a burnt offering nor a sacrifice to other gods, but to the LORD.","18":"“Regarding this matter may the LORD forgive your servant: when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my hand and I bow down in the house of Rimmon, when I bow down in the house of Rimmon, may the LORD please forgive your servant in this matter.”","19":"He said to him, “Go in peace.” So he went some distance from him.","20":"But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, thought, “Behold, my master has spared this Naaman the Aramean, by not accepting from his hand what he brought. As the LORD lives, I will run after him and take something from him.”","21":"So Gehazi pursued Naaman. When Naaman saw someone running after him, he came down from the chariot to meet him and said, “Is everything well?”","22":"And he said, “Everything is well. My master has sent me, saying, ‘Behold, just now two young men of the sons of the prophets have come to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of silver and two changes of clothes.’”","23":"Naaman said, “Be sure to take two talents.” And he urged him, and tied up two talents of silver in two bags with two changes of clothes, and gave them to two of his servants; and they carried them before him.","24":"When he came to the hill, he took them from their hand and deposited them in the house, and he sent the men away, and they departed.","25":"But he went in and stood before his master. And Elisha said to him, “Where have you been, Gehazi?” And he said, “Your servant went nowhere.”","26":"Then he said to him, “Did my heart not go with you, when the man turned from his chariot to meet you? Is it a time to accept money and to accept clothes, olive groves, vineyards, sheep, oxen, and male and female slaves?","27":"“Therefore, the leprosy of Naaman shall cling to you and to your descendants forever.” So he went out from his presence afflicted with leprosy, as white as snow."},"6":{"1":"Now the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, “Behold now, the place before you where we are living is too cramped for us.","2":"“Please let us go to the Jordan, and let us each take from there a beam, and let us construct a place there for ourselves, to live there.” So he said, “Go.”","3":"Then one of them said, “Please agree and go with your servants.” And he said, “I will go.”","4":"So he went with them; and when they came to the Jordan, they cut down trees.","5":"But it happened that as one of them was cutting down a beam, the axe head fell into the water; and he cried out and said, “Oh, my master! It was borrowed!”","6":"Then the man of God said, “Where did it fall?” And when he showed him the place, he cut off a stick and threw it in there, and made the iron float.","7":"Then he said, “Pick it up for yourself.” So he reached out his hand and took it.","8":"Now the king of Aram was making war against Israel; and he consulted with his servants, saying, “In such and such a place shall be my camp.”","9":"But the man of God sent word to the king of Israel, saying, “Be careful that you do not pass this place, because the Arameans are coming down there.”","10":"And the king of Israel sent scouts to the place about which the man of God had told him; so he warned him, so that he was on his guard there, more than once or twice.","11":"Now the heart of the king of Aram was enraged over this matter; and he called his servants and said to them, “Will you not tell me which of us is for the king of Israel?”","12":"One of his servants said, “No, my lord, the king; but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedroom.”","13":"So he said, “Go and see where he is, so that I may send men and take him.” And it was told to him, saying, “Behold, he is in Dothan.”","14":"So he sent horses and chariots and a substantial army there, and they came by night and surrounded the city.","15":"Now when the attendant of the man of God had risen early and gone out, behold, an army with horses and chariots was circling the city. And his servant said to him, “This is hopeless, my master! What are we to do?”","16":"And he said, “Do not be afraid, for those who are with us are greater than those who are with them.”","17":"Then Elisha prayed and said, “LORD, please, open his eyes so that he may see.” And the LORD opened the servant’s eyes, and he saw; and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.","18":"And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed to the LORD and said, “Please strike this people with blindness.” So He struck them with blindness in accordance with the word of Elisha.","19":"Then Elisha said to them, “This is not the way, nor is this the city; follow me and I will bring you to the man whom you seek.” And he brought them to Samaria.","20":"When they had come into Samaria, Elisha said, “LORD, open the eyes of these men, so that they may see.” So the LORD opened their eyes, and they saw; and behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.","21":"Then the king of Israel when he saw them, said to Elisha, “My father, shall I kill them? Shall I kill them?”","22":"But he answered, “You shall not kill them. Would you kill those whom you have taken captive with your sword and your bow? Set bread and water before them, so that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.”","23":"So he provided a large feast for them; and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. And the marauding bands of Arameans did not come again into the land of Israel.","24":"Now it came about after this, that Ben-hadad the king of Aram gathered all his army, and went up and besieged Samaria.","25":"So there was a severe famine in Samaria; and behold, they kept besieging it until a donkey’s head was sold for eighty shekels of silver, and a fourth of a kab of dove’s dung for five shekels of silver.","26":"And as the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried out to him, saying, “Help, my lord the king!”","27":"But he said, “If the LORD does not help you, from where am I to help you? From the threshing floor, or from the wine press?”","28":"Then the king said to her, “What is on your mind?” And she said, “This woman said to me, ‘Give your son so that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.’","29":"“So we cooked my son and ate him; and I said to her on the next day, ‘Give your son, so that we may eat him’; but she has hidden her son.”","30":"When the king heard the woman’s words, he tore his clothes—and he was passing by on the wall—and the people looked, and behold, he had sackcloth underneath on his body.","31":"Then he said, “May God do so to me and more so, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat remains on him today.”","32":"Now Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. And the king sent a man from his presence; but before the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, “Do you see how this son of a murderer has sent a man to cut off my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door and hold the door shut against him. Is the sound of his master’s feet not behind him?”","33":"While he was still talking with them, behold, the messenger came down to him and he said, “Behold, this evil is from the LORD; why should I wait for the LORD any longer?”"},"7":{"1":"Then Elisha said, “Listen to the word of the LORD; this is what the LORD says: ‘About this time tomorrow a measure of fine flour will be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, at the gate of Samaria.’”","2":"The royal officer on whose hand the king was leaning responded to the man of God and said, “Even if the LORD were to make windows in heaven, could this thing happen?” Then he said, “Behold, you are going to see it with your own eyes, but you will not eat any of it.”","3":"Now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate; and they said to one another, “Why are we sitting here until we die?","4":"“If we say, ‘We will enter the city,’ then the famine is in the city and we will die there; but if we sit here, we will also die. Now then come, and let’s go over to the camp of the Arameans. If they spare us, we will live; and if they kill us, then we will die.”","5":"So they got up at twilight to go to the camp of the Arameans; when they came to the outskirts of the camp of the Arameans, behold, there was no one there.","6":"For the Lord had made the army of the Arameans hear a sound of chariots, a sound of horses, that is, the sound of a great army; and they said to one another, “Behold, the king of Israel has hired the kings of the Hittites and the kings of the Egyptians against us, to attack us!”","7":"So they got up and fled at twilight, and abandoned their tents, their horses, and their donkeys—indeed the camp itself, just as it was; and they fled for their lives.","8":"When these men with leprosy came to the outskirts of the camp, they entered one tent and ate and drank, and carried from there silver, gold, and clothes, and they went and hid them; then they returned and entered another tent, and carried valuables from there also, and went and hid them.","9":"Then they said to one another, “We are not doing the right thing. This day is a day of good news, but we are keeping silent about it; if we wait until the morning light, punishment will overtake us. Now then come, let’s go and inform the king’s household.”","10":"So they came and called to the gatekeepers of the city, and told them, saying, “We came to the camp of the Arameans, and behold, there was no one there, nor a human voice; only the horses tied and the donkeys tied, and the tents just as they were.”","11":"And the gatekeepers called and announced it inside the king’s house.","12":"Then the king got up in the night and said to his servants, “I will now tell you what the Arameans have done to us. They know that we are hungry; so they have left the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, ‘When they come out of the city, we will capture them alive and get into the city.’”","13":"One of his servants responded and said, “Please, have some men take five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city. Behold, they will be in any case like all the multitude of Israel who are left in it; behold, they will be like all the multitude of Israel who have already perished, so let us send them and see.”","14":"Therefore they took two chariots with horses, and the king sent them after the army of the Arameans, saying, “Go and see.”","15":"They went after them to the Jordan, and behold, all the way was full of clothes and equipment which the Arameans had thrown away when they fled in a hurry. Then the messengers returned and informed the king.","16":"So the people went out and plundered the camp of the Arameans. Then a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in accordance with the word of the LORD.","17":"Now the king appointed the royal officer on whose hand he leaned to be in charge of the gate; but the people trampled on him at the gate, and he died, just as the man of God had said, who spoke when the king came down to him.","18":"So it happened just as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, “Two measures of barley for a shekel and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, will be sold about this time tomorrow at the gate of Samaria.”","19":"At that time the royal officer had responded to the man of God and said, “Now even if the LORD were to make windows in heaven, could such a thing as this happen?” And he had said, “Behold, you are going to see it with your own eyes, but you will not eat any of it.”","20":"And this is what happened to him, for the people trampled on him at the gate and he died."},"8":{"1":"Now Elisha spoke to the woman whose son he had restored to life, saying, “Arise and go with your household, and live wherever you can live; for the LORD has called for a famine, and it will indeed come on the land for seven years.”","2":"So the woman arose and acted in accordance with the word of the man of God: she went with her household and resided in the land of the Philistines for seven years.","3":"Then at the end of seven years, the woman returned from the land of the Philistines; and she went to appeal to the king for her house and for her field.","4":"Now the king was speaking with Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, saying, “Please report to me all the great things that Elisha has done.”","5":"And as he was reporting to the king how he had restored to life the one who was dead, behold, the woman whose son he had restored to life appealed to the king for her house and for her field. And Gehazi said, “My lord the king, this is the woman and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.”","6":"When the king asked the woman, she told everything to him. So the king appointed an officer for her, saying, “Restore all that was hers and all the produce of the field from the day that she left the land even until now.”","7":"Then Elisha came to Damascus. Now Ben-hadad, the king of Aram, was sick, and it was told to him, saying, “The man of God has come here.”","8":"And the king said to Hazael, “Take a gift in your hand and go to meet the man of God, and inquire of the LORD by him, saying, ‘Will I recover from this sickness?’”","9":"So Hazael went to meet him and took a gift in his hand, even every kind of good thing of Damascus, forty camels’ loads; and he came and stood before him and said, “Your son Ben-hadad king of Aram has sent me to you, saying, ‘Will I recover from this sickness?’”","10":"Then Elisha said to him, “Go, say to him, ‘You will certainly recover’; but the LORD has shown me that he will certainly die.”","11":"And he stared steadily at him until Hazael was embarrassed, and then the man of God wept.","12":"And Hazael said, “Why is my lord weeping?” And he answered, “Because I know the evil that you will do to the sons of Israel: you will set their fortified cities on fire, you will kill their young men with the sword, their little ones you will smash to pieces, and you will rip up their pregnant women.”","13":"Then Hazael said, “But what is your servant—a lowly dog—that he could do this great thing?” And Elisha answered, “The LORD has shown me that you will be king over Aram.”","14":"So he left Elisha and came to his master, who said to him, “What did Elisha say to you?” And he answered, “He told me that you would certainly recover.”","15":"But on the following day, he took the cover and dipped it in water, and spread it over his face, so that he died. And Hazael became king in his place.","16":"Now in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, when Jehoshaphat was the king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah became king.","17":"He was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned for eight years in Jerusalem.","18":"He walked in the way of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab had done, for Ahab’s daughter was his wife; and he did evil in the sight of the LORD.","19":"However, the LORD did not want to destroy Judah, for the sake of David His servant, since He had promised him to give him a lamp through his sons always.","20":"In his days Edom broke away from the rule of Judah, and appointed a king over themselves.","21":"Then Joram crossed over to Zair, and all his chariots with him. And he got up at night and struck the Edomites who had surrounded him and the captains of the chariots; but his army fled to their tents.","22":"So Edom has broken away from Judah to this day. Then Libnah broke away at the same time.","23":"Now the rest of the acts of Joram and everything that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?","24":"So Joram lay down with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David; and his son Ahaziah became king in his place.","25":"In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign.","26":"Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned for one year in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Athaliah the granddaughter of Omri king of Israel.","27":"He walked in the way of the house of Ahab and did evil in the sight of the LORD, like the house of Ahab, because he was a son-in-law of the house of Ahab.","28":"Then he went with Joram the son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth-gilead, and the Arameans wounded Joram.","29":"So King Joram returned to have himself healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Arameans had inflicted on him at Ramah when he fought against Hazael king of Aram. Then Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel because he was sick."},"9":{"1":"Now Elisha the prophet summoned one of the sons of the prophets and said to him, “Get ready and take this flask of oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth-gilead.","2":"“When you arrive there, then look there for Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in and have him get up from among his brothers, and bring him to an inner room.","3":"“Then take the flask of oil and pour it on his head, and say, ‘This is what the LORD says: “I have anointed you king over Israel.”’ Then open the door and flee, and do not wait.”","4":"So the young man, the servant of the prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead.","5":"When he arrived, behold, the commanders of the army were sitting, and he said, “I have a word for you, commander.” And Jehu said, “For which one of us?” And he said, “For you, commander.”","6":"He then got up and went into the house, and the prophet’s servant poured the oil on his head and said to him, “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel says: ‘I have anointed you king over the people of the LORD, over Israel.","7":"‘And you shall strike the house of Ahab your master, so that I may avenge the blood of My servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel.","8":"‘For the entire house of Ahab shall perish, and I will eliminate from Ahab every male person both slave and free in Israel.","9":"‘I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah.","10":"‘The dogs will eat Jezebel in the territory of Jezreel, and no one will bury her.’” Then he opened the door and fled.","11":"Now Jehu went out to the servants of his master, and one said to him, “Is everything well? Why did this crazy fellow come to you?” And he said to them, “You know very well the man and his talk.”","12":"And they said, “It is a lie; tell us now.” And he said, “Such and such he said to me, saying, ‘This is what the LORD says: “I have anointed you king over Israel.”’”","13":"Then they hurried, and each man took his garment and put it under him on the bare steps, and blew the trumpet, saying, “Jehu is king!”","14":"So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. Now Joram with all Israel was defending Ramoth-gilead against Hazael king of Aram,","15":"but King Joram had returned to Jezreel to have himself healed of the wounds which the Arameans had inflicted on him when he fought Hazael king of Aram. So Jehu said to the other men, “If this is your intent, then let no one escape from the city to go tell about it in Jezreel.”","16":"Then Jehu rode in a chariot and went to Jezreel, since Joram was lying there recovering. And Ahaziah the king of Judah had come down to see Joram.","17":"Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel and he saw the company of Jehu as he came, and he said, “I see a company.” And Joram said, “Take a horseman and send him to meet them and have him ask, ‘Is your intention peace?’”","18":"So a horseman went to meet him and said, “This is what the king says: ‘Is your intention peace?’” But Jehu said, “How is peace any business of yours? Turn and follow me.” And the watchman reported, “The messenger came to them, but he did not return.”","19":"Then he sent a second horseman, and he came to them and said, “This is what the king says: ‘Is your intention peace?’” And Jehu answered, “How is peace any business of yours? Turn and follow me.”","20":"And the watchman reported, “He came up to them, but he did not return; and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi, for he drives furiously.”","21":"Then Joram said, “Get ready.” And they made his chariot ready. Then Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out to meet Jehu and found him on the property of Naboth the Jezreelite.","22":"When Joram saw Jehu, he said, “Is your intention peace, Jehu?” And he answered, “What ‘peace,’ so long as your mother Jezebel’s acts of prostitution and witchcraft are so many?”","23":"So Joram turned back and fled, and he said to Ahaziah, “There is treachery, Ahaziah!”","24":"Then Jehu drew his bow with his full strength and shot Joram between his arms; and the arrow went through his heart, and he sank in his chariot.","25":"And Jehu said to Bidkar his officer, “Pick him up and throw him on the property of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite; for remember, when you and I were riding together after his father Ahab, that the LORD brought this pronouncement against him:","26":"‘I have certainly seen yesterday the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons,’ declares the LORD, ‘and I will repay you on this property,’ declares the LORD. Now then, pick him up and throw him on the property, in accordance with the word of the LORD.”","27":"When Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by way of the garden house. But Jehu pursued him and said, “Shoot him too, in the chariot.” So they shot him at the ascent of Gur, which is at Ibleam.

And he said, “This is the word of the LORD, which He spoke by His servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, ‘On the property of Jezreel the dogs shall eat the flesh of Jezebel;","37":"and the corpse of Jezebel will be like dung on the face of the field in the property of Jezreel, so they cannot say, “This is Jezebel.”’”"},"10":{"1":"Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria, to the officials of Jezreel, the elders, and to the guardians of the children of Ahab, saying,","2":"“And now, when this letter comes to you, since your master’s sons are with you, as well as the chariots and horses, and a fortified city and the weapons,","3":"select the best and most capable of your master’s sons and seat him on his father’s throne, and fight for your master’s house.”","4":"But they feared greatly and said, “Behold, the two kings did not stand firm before him; how then can we stand?”","5":"And the one who was in charge of the household, and the one who was in charge of the city, and the elders, and the guardians of the children, sent word to Jehu, saying, “We are your servants, and everything that you tell us we will do.

On the way while he was at Beth-eked of the shepherds,","13":"Jehu encountered the relatives of Ahaziah king of Judah, and he said, “Who are you?” And they answered, “We are the relatives of Ahaziah; and we have come down to greet the sons of the king and the sons of the queen mother.”","14":"Then he said, “Take them alive.” So they took them alive, and slaughtered them at the pit of Beth-eked, forty-two men; and he left none of them.","15":"Now when he had gone from there, he encountered Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him; and he greeted him and said to him, “Is your heart right, just as my heart is with your heart?” And Jehonadab answered, “It is.” Jehu said, “If it is, give me your hand.” And he gave him his hand, and he pulled him up to him into the chariot.","16":"Then he said, “Come with me and see my zeal for the LORD.” So he had him ride in his chariot.","17":"When he came to Samaria, he killed all who remained to Ahab in Samaria, until he had eliminated them, in accordance with the word of the LORD which He spoke to Elijah.","18":"Then Jehu gathered all the people and said to them, “Ahab served Baal a little; Jehu will serve him much.","19":"“Now, summon to me all the prophets of Baal, all his worshipers and all his priests; let no one go missing, because I have a great sacrifice for Baal; whoever is missing shall not live.” But Jehu did it in deception, in order to eliminate the worshipers of Baal.","20":"And Jehu said, “Proclaim a holy assembly for Baal.” And they proclaimed it.","21":"Then Jehu sent word throughout Israel, and all the worshipers of Baal came, so that there was not a person left who did not come.

You have surpassed the report that I heard.","7":"“How blessed are your men, how blessed are these servants of yours, who stand before you continually and hear your wisdom!","8":"“Blessed be the LORD your God who delighted in you, setting you on His throne as king for the LORD your God; because your God loved Israel, establishing them forever, He made you king over them, to carry out justice and righteousness.”","9":"Then she gave the king 120 talents of gold and a very great amount of balsam oil and precious stones; there had never been balsam oil like that which the queen of Sheba gave King Solomon.","10":"The servants of Huram and the servants of Solomon who brought gold from Ophir, also brought algum trees and precious stones.","11":"From the algum trees the king made steps to the house of the LORD and for the king’s palace, and lyres and harps for the singers; and nothing like them was seen before in the land of Judah.","12":"King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba her every desire, whatever she requested, besides gifts equal to what she had brought to the king. Then she turned and went to her own land with her servants.","13":"Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was 666 talents of gold,","14":"besides what the traders and merchants brought; and all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.","15":"King Solomon made two hundred large shields of beaten gold, using six hundred shekels of beaten gold on each large shield.","16":"He made three hundred shields of beaten gold, using three hundred shekels of gold on each shield; and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.","17":"Moreover, the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold.","18":"There were six steps to the throne and a footstool in gold attached to the throne, and arms on each side of the seat, and two lions standing beside the arms.","19":"Twelve lions were standing there on the six steps on the one side and on the other; nothing like it was made for any other kingdom.","20":"All King Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; silver was not considered valuable in the days of Solomon.","21":"For the king had ships which went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram; once every three years the ships of Tarshish came bringing gold and silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.","22":"So King Solomon became greater than all the kings of the earth in wealth and wisdom.","23":"And all the kings of the earth were seeking the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom which God had put in his heart.","24":"They were bringing, each of them his gift: articles of silver and gold, garments, weapons, balsam oil, horses, and mules, so much year by year.","25":"Now Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, and he stationed them in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.","26":"He was ruler over all the kings from the Euphrates River to the land of the Philistines, and as far as the border of Egypt.","27":"And the king made silver as common as stones in Jerusalem, and he made cedars as plentiful as sycamore trees that are in the lowland.","28":"And they were bringing horses for Solomon from Egypt and from all countries.","29":"Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, from the first to the last, are they not written in the records of Nathan the prophet, in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat?","30":"Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel for forty years.","31":"And Solomon lay down with his fathers and was buried in the city of his father David; and his son Rehoboam reigned in his place."},"10":{"1":"Then Rehoboam went to Shechem, because all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king.","2":"When Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard about it (he was in Egypt where he had fled from the presence of King Solomon), Jeroboam returned from Egypt.","3":"So they sent word and summoned him.

My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions!’”","12":"So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, just as the king had directed, saying, “Return to me on the third day.”","13":"The king answered them harshly, and King Rehoboam ignored the advice of the elders.","14":"He spoke to them according to the advice of the young men, saying, “My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it; my father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.”","15":"So the king did not listen to the people, because it was a turn of events from God so that the LORD might establish His word, which He spoke through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.","16":"When all Israel saw that the king had not listened to them, the people replied to the king, saying,\n“What share do we have in David?\nWe have no inheritance in the son of Jesse.\nEveryone to your tents, Israel!\nNow look after your own house, David!”\nSo all Israel went away to their tents.","17":"But as for the sons of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.","18":"Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was in charge of the forced labor, and the sons of Israel stoned him to death.

Leave the sanctuary, for you have been untrue and will have no honor from the LORD God.”","19":"But Uzziah, with a censer in his hand for burning incense, was enraged; and while he was enraged with the priests, leprosy broke out on his forehead in the presence of the priests in the house of the LORD, beside the altar of incense.","20":"Azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked at him, and behold, he was leprous on his forehead; and they quickly removed him from there, and he himself also hurried to get out because the LORD had stricken him.","21":"King Uzziah had leprosy to the day of his death; and he lived in a separate house, afflicted as he was with leprosy, for he was cut off from the house of the LORD. And his son Jotham was over the king’s house, judging the people of the land.","22":"Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, the first to the last, the prophet Isaiah, the son of Amoz, has written.","23":"So Uzziah lay down with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the grave which belonged to the kings, for they said, “He had leprosy.” And his son Jotham became king in his place."},"27":{"1":"Jotham was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok.","2":"He did what was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Uzziah had done; however he did not enter the temple of the LORD. But the people continued acting corruptly.","3":"He built the upper gate of the house of the LORD, and he built the wall of Ophel extensively.","4":"Moreover, he built cities in the hill country of Judah, and he built fortresses and towers on the wooded hills.","5":"He fought with the king of the Ammonites and prevailed over them so that during that year the Ammonites gave him a hundred talents of silver, ten thousand kors of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. The Ammonites also paid him this amount in the second year and in the third.","6":"So Jotham became powerful because he directed his ways before the LORD his God.","7":"Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, all his wars and his ways, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.","8":"He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem for sixteen years.","9":"And Jotham lay down with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David; and his son Ahaz became king in his place."},"28":{"1":"Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem for sixteen years. He did not do what was right in the sight of the LORD as his father David had done.","2":"But he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel; he also made cast metal images for the Baals.","3":"Furthermore, he burned incense in the Valley of Ben-hinnom, and burned his sons in fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom the LORD had driven out from the sons of Israel.","4":"He sacrificed and burned incense on the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree.","5":"Therefore the LORD his God handed him over to the king of Aram; and they defeated him and carried from him a great number of captives, and brought them to Damascus. And he was also handed over to the king of Israel, who struck him with heavy casualties.","6":"For Pekah the son of Remaliah killed 120,000 in Judah in one day, all valiant men, because they had abandoned the LORD God of their fathers.","7":"And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the king’s son, Azrikam the ruler of the house, and Elkanah the second to the king.","8":"The sons of Israel led away captive two hundred thousand of their relatives, women, sons, and daughters; and they also took a great deal of spoils from them, and brought the spoils to Samaria.","9":"But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded; and he went out to meet the army which came to Samaria and said to them, “Behold, because the LORD, the God of your fathers, was angry with Judah, He has handed them over to you, and you have killed them in a rage which has even reached heaven.","10":"“Now you are proposing to subjugate the people of Judah and Jerusalem as male and female slaves for yourselves. Are you not, however guilty yourselves of offenses against the LORD your God?","11":"“Now then, listen to me and return the captives whom you captured from your brothers, for the burning anger of the LORD is against you.”","12":"Then some of the leading men of the sons of Ephraim—Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai—rose up against those who were coming from the battle,","13":"and said to them, “You must not bring the captives in here, for you are proposing to bring guilt upon us before the LORD, adding to our sins and our guilt; for our guilt is great, and His burning anger is against Israel.”","14":"So the armed men left the captives and the spoils before the officers and all the assembly.","15":"Then the men who were designated by name got up, took the captives, and they clothed all their naked people from the spoils; they gave them clothes and sandals, fed them and gave them drink, anointed them with oil, led all their feeble ones on donkeys, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brothers; then they returned to Samaria.","16":"At that time King Ahaz sent word to the kings of Assyria for help.","17":"For the Edomites had come again and attacked Judah, and led away captives.","18":"The Philistines had also invaded the cities of the lowland and of the Negev of Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, and Soco with its villages, Timnah with its villages, and Gimzo with its villages; and they had settled there.","19":"For the LORD had humbled Judah because of Ahaz king of Israel, for he had brought about a lack of restraint in Judah and was very unfaithful to the LORD.","20":"So Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria came against him and afflicted him instead of strengthening him.","21":"Although Ahaz took a portion out of the house of the LORD and out of the palace of the king and of the princes, and gave it to the king of Assyria, it did not help him.","22":"Now during the time of his distress, this same King Ahaz became even more unfaithful to the LORD.","23":"For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus who had defeated him, and said, “Because the gods of the kings of Aram helped them, I will sacrifice to them so that they may help me.” But they became the downfall of him and all Israel.","24":"Moreover, when Ahaz gathered together the utensils of the house of God, he cut the utensils of the house of God in pieces; and he closed the doors of the house of the LORD, and made altars for himself in every corner of Jerusalem.","25":"In every city of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods, and provoked the LORD, the God of his fathers, to anger.","26":"Now the rest of his acts and all his ways, from the first to the last, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.","27":"So Ahaz lay down with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, in Jerusalem, for they did not bring him to the tombs of the kings of Israel; and his son Hezekiah reigned in his place."},"29":{"1":"Hezekiah became king when he was twenty-five years old; and he reigned for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.","2":"He did what was right in the sight of the LORD, in accordance with everything that his father David had done.","3":"In the first year of his reign, in the first month, he opened the doors of the house of the LORD and repaired them.","4":"He brought in the priests and the Levites and gathered them into the public square on the east.","5":"Then he said to them, “Listen to me, you Levites. Consecrate yourselves now, and consecrate the house of the LORD, the God of your fathers, and carry the uncleanness out of the holy place.","6":"“For our fathers have been unfaithful and have done evil in the sight of the LORD our God, and they have abandoned Him and turned their faces away from the dwelling place of the LORD, and have turned their backs.","7":"“They have also shut the doors of the porch and extinguished the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place to the God of Israel.","8":"“Therefore the wrath of the LORD was against Judah and Jerusalem, and He has made them an object of terror, of horror, and of hissing, as you see with your own eyes.","9":"“For behold, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons, our daughters, and our wives are in captivity because of this.","10":"“Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of Israel, so that His burning anger may turn away from us.","11":"“My sons, do not be negligent now, for the LORD has chosen you to stand before Him, to serve Him, and to be His ministers and burn incense.”","12":"Then the Levites arose: Mahath the son of Amasai and Joel the son of Azariah, from the sons of the Kohathites; and from the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi and Azariah the son of Jehallelel; and from the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah and Eden the son of Joah;","13":"and from the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeiel; and from the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah;","14":"and from the sons of Heman, Jehiel and Shimei; and from the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel.","15":"They assembled their brothers, consecrated themselves, and went in to cleanse the house of the LORD, according to the commandment of the king by the words of the LORD.","16":"So the priests went into the inner part of the house of the LORD to cleanse it, and they brought every unclean thing which they found in the temple of the LORD out to the courtyard of the house of the LORD. Then the Levites received it to carry out to the Kidron Valley.","17":"Now they began the consecration on the first day of the first month, and on the eighth day of the month they entered the porch of the LORD. Then they consecrated the house of the LORD in eight days, and finished on the sixteenth day of the first month.","18":"Then they went in to King Hezekiah and said, “We have cleansed the whole house of the LORD, the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the table of the showbread with all of its utensils.","19":"“Moreover, all the utensils which King Ahaz had discarded during his reign in his unfaithfulness, we have prepared and consecrated; and behold, they are before the altar of the LORD.”","20":"Then King Hezekiah got up early and assembled the princes of the city, and went up to the house of the LORD.","21":"They brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven male goats as a sin offering for the kingdom, the sanctuary, and Judah. And he ordered the priests, the sons of Aaron, to offer them on the altar of the LORD.","22":"So they slaughtered the bulls, and the priests took the blood and sprinkled it on the altar. They also slaughtered the rams and sprinkled the blood on the altar; they slaughtered the lambs as well, and sprinkled the blood on the altar.","23":"Then they brought the male goats of the sin offering before the king and the assembly, and they laid their hands on them.","24":"The priests slaughtered them and purified the altar with their blood to atone for all Israel, because the king ordered the burnt offering and the sin offering for all Israel.","25":"He then stationed the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, harps, and lyres, according to the command of David and of Gad, the king’s seer, and of Nathan the prophet; for the command was from the LORD through His prophets.","26":"The Levites stood with the musical instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.","27":"Then Hezekiah gave the order to offer the burnt offering on the altar. When the burnt offering began, the song to the LORD also began with the trumpets, accompanied by the instruments of David, king of Israel.","28":"While the whole assembly worshiped, the singers also sang and the trumpets sounded; all this continued until the burnt offering was finished.","29":"Now at the completion of the burnt offerings, the king and all who were present with him bowed down and worshiped.","30":"Moreover, King Hezekiah and the officials ordered the Levites to sing praises to the LORD with the words of David and Asaph the seer. So they sang praises with joy, and bowed down and worshiped.","31":"Then Hezekiah said, “Now that you have consecrated yourselves to the LORD, come forward and bring sacrifices and thanksgiving offerings to the house of the LORD.” So the assembly brought sacrifices and thanksgiving offerings, and everyone who was willing brought burnt offerings.","32":"The number of the burnt offerings which the assembly brought was seventy bulls, a hundred rams, and two hundred lambs; all of these were for a burnt offering to the LORD.","33":"The consecrated offerings were six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep.","34":"But the priests were too few, so that they were unable to skin all the burnt offerings; therefore their brothers the Levites helped them until the work was finished and the other priests had consecrated themselves. For the Levites were more conscientious to consecrate themselves than the priests.","35":"There were also many burnt offerings with the fat of the peace offerings and the drink offerings for the burnt offerings. So the service of the house of the LORD was established again.","36":"Then Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced over what God had prepared for the people, because the thing came about suddenly."},"30":{"1":"Now Hezekiah sent word to all Israel and Judah and also wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD in Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover to the LORD God of Israel.","2":"For the king and his princes and all the assembly in Jerusalem had decided to celebrate the Passover in the second month,","3":"since they could not celebrate it at that time, because the priests had not consecrated themselves in sufficient numbers, nor had the people been gathered to Jerusalem.","4":"So the decision was right in the sight of the king and all the assembly.","5":"So they established a decree to circulate a proclamation throughout Israel from Beersheba to Dan, that they are to come to celebrate the Passover to the LORD God of Israel in Jerusalem. For they had not celebrated it in great numbers as was written.","6":"The couriers went throughout Israel and Judah with the letters from the hand of the king and his princes, even according to the command of the king, saying, “Sons of Israel, return to the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, that He may return to those of you who escaped and are left from the hand of the kings of Assyria.","7":"“Do not be like your fathers and your brothers, who were untrue to the LORD God of their fathers, so that He made them an object of horror, just as you see.","8":"“Now do not stiffen your neck like your fathers, but yield to the LORD and enter His sanctuary which He has consecrated forever, and serve the LORD your God, that His burning anger may turn away from you.","9":"“For if you return to the LORD, your brothers and your sons will find compassion in the presence of those who led them captive, and will return to this land. For the LORD your God is gracious and compassionate, and will not turn His face away from you if you return to Him.”","10":"So the couriers passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, and as far as Zebulun, but they laughed at them with scorn and mocked them.","11":"Nevertheless, some men of Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem.","12":"The hand of God was also on Judah to give them one heart to do what the king and the princes commanded by the word of the LORD.","13":"Now many people were gathered at Jerusalem to celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread in the second month, a very large assembly.","14":"They got up and removed the altars which were in Jerusalem; they also removed all the incense altars and threw them into the brook Kidron.","15":"Then they slaughtered the Passover lambs on the fourteenth of the second month. And the priests and Levites were ashamed of themselves, and consecrated themselves and brought burnt offerings to the house of the LORD.","16":"They stood at their stations following their custom, according to the Law of Moses the man of God; the priests sprinkled the blood which they received from the hand of the Levites.","17":"For there were many in the assembly who had not consecrated themselves; therefore, the Levites were in charge of the slaughter of the Passover lambs for everyone who was unclean, in order to consecrate them to the LORD.","18":"For a multitude of the people, many from Ephraim and Manasseh, and Issachar and Zebulun, had not purified themselves, yet they ate the Passover contrary to what was written. For Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, “May the good LORD pardon","19":"everyone who prepares his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, though not according to the purification rules of the sanctuary.”","20":"So the LORD heard Hezekiah and healed the people.","21":"The sons of Israel present in Jerusalem celebrated the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days with great joy, and the Levites and the priests were praising the LORD day after day with loud instruments to the LORD.","22":"Then Hezekiah spoke encouragingly to all the Levites who showed good insight in the things of the LORD. So they ate for the appointed seven days, sacrificing peace offerings and giving thanks to the LORD God of their fathers.","23":"Then the whole assembly decided to celebrate the feast another seven days, so they celebrated the seven days with joy.","24":"For Hezekiah king of Judah had contributed to the assembly a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep, and the princes had contributed to the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep; and a large number of priests consecrated themselves.","25":"All the assembly of Judah rejoiced, with the priests and the Levites and all the assembly that came from Israel, both the strangers who came from the land of Israel and those living in Judah.","26":"So there was great joy in Jerusalem, because there was nothing like this in Jerusalem since the days of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel.","27":"Then the Levitical priests stood and blessed the people; and their voice was heard and their prayer came to His holy dwelling place, to heaven."},"31":{"1":"Now when all this was finished, all Israel who were present went out to the cities of Judah, broke the memorial stones in pieces, cut down the Asherim and pulled down the high places and the altars throughout Judah and Benjamin, as well as in Ephraim and Manasseh, until they had destroyed them all. Then all the sons of Israel returned to their cities, each to his possession.","2":"And Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests and the Levites by their divisions, each according to his service, both the priests and the Levites, for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to serve and to give thanks and to praise in the gates of the camp of the LORD.","3":"He also appointed the king’s portion of his property for the burnt offerings, namely, for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the Sabbaths and for the new moons and for the appointed festivals, as it is written in the Law of the LORD.","4":"Also he told the people who lived in Jerusalem to give the portion due to the priests and the Levites, so that they might devote themselves to the Law of the LORD.","5":"As soon as the order spread, the sons of Israel abundantly provided the first fruits of grain, new wine, oil, honey, and of all the produce of the field; and they brought in abundantly the tithe of everything.","6":"The sons of Israel and Judah who lived in the cities of Judah also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of sacred gifts which were consecrated to the LORD their God, and placed them in heaps.","7":"In the third month they began to make the heaps, and they finished them by the seventh month.","8":"When Hezekiah and the rulers came and saw the heaps, they blessed the LORD and His people Israel.","9":"Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.","10":"Azariah, the chief priest of the house of Zadok, said to him, “Since the contributions started coming into the house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat with plenty left over, for the LORD has blessed His people, and this great quantity is left over.”","11":"Then Hezekiah commanded them to prepare rooms in the house of the LORD, and they prepared them.","12":"They faithfully brought in the contributions, the tithes, and the consecrated things; and Conaniah the Levite was the officer in charge of them, and his brother Shimei was second.","13":"Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah were overseers under the authority of Conaniah and his brother Shimei by the appointment of King Hezekiah, and Azariah was the chief officer of the house of God.","14":"Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the keeper of the eastern gate, was in charge of the voluntary offerings for God, to distribute the contributions for the LORD and the most holy things.","15":"Under his authority were Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, to distribute their portions faithfully to their brothers by divisions, whether great or small,","16":"without regard to their genealogical enrollment, to the males from thirty years old and upward—everyone who entered the house of the LORD for his daily obligations—for their work in their duties according to their divisions;","17":"as well as the priests who were enrolled genealogically according to their fathers’ households, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, by their duties and their divisions.","18":"The genealogical enrollment included all their little children, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, for the whole assembly, for they consecrated themselves faithfully in holiness.","19":"Also for the sons of Aaron, the priests, who were in the pasture lands of their cities, or in each and every city, there were men who were designated by name to distribute portions to every male among the priests and to everyone genealogically enrolled among the Levites.","20":"Hezekiah did this throughout Judah; and he did what was good, right, and true before the LORD his God.","21":"Every work which he began in the service of the house of God in the Law and in the commandment, seeking his God, he did with all his heart and prospered."},"32":{"1":"After these acts of faithfulness Sennacherib king of Assyria came and invaded Judah and besieged the fortified cities, and intended to break into them for himself.","2":"Now when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come and that he intended to wage war against Jerusalem,","3":"he decided with his officers and his warriors to cut off the supply of water from the springs which were outside the city, and they helped him.","4":"So many people assembled and stopped up all the springs and the stream which flowed through the region, saying, “Why should the kings of Assyria come and find abundant water?”","5":"And he resolutely set to work and rebuilt all of the wall that had been broken down and erected towers on it, and built another outside wall and strengthened the Millo in the city of David, and made weapons and shields in great numbers.","6":"He appointed military officers over the people and gathered them to him in the public square at the city gate, and spoke encouragingly to them, saying,","7":"“Be strong and courageous, do not fear or be dismayed because of the king of Assyria nor because of all the horde that is with him; for the One with us is greater than the one with him.","8":"“With him is only an arm of flesh, but with us is the LORD our God to help us and to fight our battles.” And the people relied on the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.","9":"After this Sennacherib king of Assyria sent his servants to Jerusalem while he was besieging Lachish with all his forces with him, against Hezekiah king of Judah and against all of Judah who were in Jerusalem, saying,","10":"“This is what Sennacherib king of Assyria says: ‘On what are you trusting that you are staying in Jerusalem under siege?","11":"‘Is Hezekiah not misleading you to give yourselves over to die by hunger and by thirst, saying, “The LORD our God will save us from the hand of the king of Assyria”?","12":"‘Is it not the same Hezekiah who removed His high places and His altars, and said to Judah and Jerusalem, “You shall worship before one altar, and on it you shall burn incense”?","13":"‘Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the nations of those lands at all able to save their land from my hand?","14":"‘Who was there among all the gods of those nations which my fathers utterly destroyed who could save his people from my hand, that your God would be able to save you from my hand?","15":"‘Now then, do not let Hezekiah deceive you or mislead you like this, and do not believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to save his people from my hand or from the hand of my fathers. How much less will your God save you from my hand?’”","16":"His servants spoke further against the LORD God and against His servant Hezekiah.","17":"He also wrote letters to insult the LORD God of Israel, and to speak against Him, saying, “As the gods of the nations of the lands have not saved their people from my hand, so the God of Hezekiah will not save His people from my hand.”","18":"They called this out with a loud voice in the language of Judah to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to frighten and terrify them, so that they might take the city.","19":"They spoke of the God of Jerusalem as they did against the gods of the peoples of the earth, the work of human hands.","20":"But King Hezekiah and Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, prayed about this and called out to heaven for help.","21":"And the LORD sent an angel who destroyed every warrior, commander, and officer in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned in shame to his own land. And when he had entered the temple of his god, some of his own sons killed him there with the sword.","22":"So the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria and from the hand of all others, and guided them on every side.","23":"And many were bringing gifts to the LORD at Jerusalem and valuable presents to Hezekiah king of Judah; so thereafter he rose in the sight of all nations.","24":"In those days Hezekiah became mortally ill; and he prayed to the LORD, and the LORD spoke to him and gave him a sign.","25":"But Hezekiah did nothing in return for the benefit he received, because his heart was proud; therefore wrath came upon him and upon Judah and Jerusalem.","26":"However, Hezekiah humbled the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD did not come on them in the days of Hezekiah.","27":"Now Hezekiah had immense riches and honor; and he made for himself treasuries for silver, gold, precious stones, spices, shields, and all kinds of valuable articles,","28":"also storehouses for the produce of grain, wine, and oil; stalls for all kinds of cattle, and sheepfolds for the flocks.","29":"He made cities for himself and acquired flocks and herds in abundance, because God had given him very great wealth.","30":"It was Hezekiah who stopped the upper outlet of the waters of Gihon and directed them to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah was successful in everything that he did.","31":"Even in the matter of the messengers of the rulers of Babylon, who were sent to him to inquire about the wonder that had happened in the land; God left him alone only to test him, so that He might know everything that was in his heart.","32":"Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and his deeds of devotion, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.","33":"So Hezekiah lay down with his fathers, and they buried him in the upper section of the tombs of the sons of David; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem honored him at his death. And his son Manasseh became king in his place."},"33":{"1":"Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned for fifty-five years in Jerusalem.","2":"He did evil in the sight of the LORD according to the abominations of the nations whom the LORD dispossessed before the sons of Israel.","3":"For he rebuilt the high places which his father Hezekiah had torn down; he also set up altars for the Baals and made Asherim, and he worshiped all the heavenly lights and served them.","4":"He built altars in the house of the LORD of which the LORD had said, “My name shall be in Jerusalem forever.”","5":"He built altars for all the heavenly lights in the two courtyards of the house of the LORD.","6":"He also made his sons pass through the fire in the Valley of Ben-hinnom; and he practiced witchcraft, used divination, practiced sorcery, and dealt with mediums and spiritists. He did much evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking Him to anger.","7":"Then he put the carved image of the idol which he had made in the house of God, of which God had said to David and his son Solomon, “In this house and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel, I will put My name forever;","8":"and I will not remove the foot of Israel again from the land which I have appointed for your fathers, if only they will take care to do everything that I have commanded them according to all the Law, the statutes, and the ordinances given through Moses.”","9":"So Manasseh encouraged Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to do more evil than the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the sons of Israel.","10":"So the LORD spoke to Manasseh and his people, but they paid no attention.","11":"Therefore the LORD brought the commanders of the army of the king of Assyria against them, and they captured Manasseh with hooks, bound him with bronze chains, and led him to Babylon.","12":"When he was in distress, he appeased the LORD his God and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers.","13":"When he prayed to Him, He was moved by him and heard his pleading, and brought him back to Jerusalem to his kingdom.

I did not tell anyone what my God was putting into my mind to do for Jerusalem, and there was no animal with me except the animal on which I was riding.","13":"So I went out at night by the Valley Gate in the direction of the Dragon’s Spring and on to the Dung Gate, and I was inspecting the walls of Jerusalem which were broken down and its gates which had been consumed by fire.","14":"Then I passed on to the Fountain Gate and the King’s Pool, but there was no place for my mount to pass.","15":"So I was going up at night by the ravine and inspecting the wall. Then I entered the Valley Gate again and returned.","16":"However, the officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing; nor had I as yet told the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the officials, or the rest who were doing the work.","17":"Then I said to them, “You see the bad situation we are in, that Jerusalem is desolate and its gates have been burned by fire. Come, let’s rebuild the wall of Jerusalem so that we will no longer be a disgrace.”","18":"And I told them how the hand of my God had been favorable to me and also about the king’s words which he had spoken to me. Then they said, “Let’s arise and build.” So they put their hands to the good work.","19":"But when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official, and Geshem the Arab heard about it, they mocked us and despised us, and said, “What is this thing that you are doing?

Are they going to restore the temple for themselves? Can they offer sacrifices? Can they finish it in a day? Can they revive the stones from the heaps of rubble, even the burned ones?”","3":"Now Tobiah the Ammonite was near him, and he said, “Even what they are building—if a fox were to jump on it, it would break their stone wall down!”","4":"Hear, O our God, how we are an object of contempt! Return their taunting on their own heads, and turn them into plunder in a land of captivity.","5":"Do not forgive their guilt and do not let their sin be wiped out before You, for they have demoralized the builders.","6":"So we built the wall, and the entire wall was joined together to half its height, for the people had a mind to work.","7":"Now when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the repair of the walls of Jerusalem went on, and that the breaches began to be closed, they were very angry.","8":"So all of them conspired together to come to fight against Jerusalem and to cause confusion in it.","9":"But we prayed to our God, and because of them we set up a guard against them day and night.","10":"And so in Judah it was said:\n“The strength of the burden bearers is failing,\nYet there is much rubble;\nAnd we ourselves are unable\nTo rebuild the wall.”","11":"And our enemies said, “They will not know or see until we come among them, kill them, and put a stop to the work.”","12":"When the Jews who lived near them came and told us ten times, “They will come up against us from every place where you may turn,”","13":"then I stationed men in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, the exposed places, and I stationed the people in families with their swords, spears, and bows.","14":"When I saw their fear, I stood and said to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people: “Do not be afraid of them; remember the Lord who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your houses.”","15":"Now when our enemies heard that it was known to us, and that God had frustrated their plan, then all of us returned to the wall, each one to his work.","16":"And from that day on, half of my servants carried on the work while half of them kept hold of the spears, the shields, the bows, and the coats of mail; and the captains were behind all the house of Judah.","17":"Those who were rebuilding the wall and those who carried burdens carried with one hand doing the work, and the other keeping hold of a weapon.","18":"As for the builders, each wore his sword strapped to his waist as he built, while the trumpeter stood near me.","19":"And I said to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people, “The work is great and extensive, and we are separated on the wall far from one another.","20":"“At whatever place you hear the sound of the trumpet, assemble to us there.

Why should the work stop while I leave it and come down to you?”","4":"Then they sent messages to me four times worded in this way, and I answered them with the same wording.","5":"Then Sanballat sent his servant to me in the same way a fifth time with an open letter in his hand.","6":"In it was written: “It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu says, that you and the Jews intend to rebel; for that reason you are rebuilding the wall. And you are to be their king, according to these reports.","7":"“You have also appointed prophets to proclaim in Jerusalem concerning you, ‘A king is in Judah!’ And now it will be reported to the king according to these reports. So come now, let’s consult together.”","8":"Then I sent a message to him saying, “Nothing like these things that you are saying has been done, but you are inventing them in your own mind.”","9":"For all of them were trying to frighten us, thinking, “They will become discouraged with the work and it will not be done.” But now, God, strengthen my hands.","10":"When I entered the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, son of Mehetabel, who was confined at home, he said, “Let’s meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let’s close the doors of the temple, for they are coming to kill you, and they are coming to kill you at night.”","11":"But I said, “Should a man like me flee? And who is there like me who would go into the temple to save his own life? I will not go in.”","12":"Then I realized that God certainly had not sent him, but he uttered his prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.","13":"He was hired for this reason, that I would become frightened and act accordingly and sin, so that they might have an evil report in order that they could taunt me.","14":"Remember, my God, Tobiah and Sanballat in accordance with these works of theirs, and also Noadiah the prophetess and the rest of the prophets, who were trying to frighten me.","15":"So the wall was completed on the twenty-fifth of the month Elul, in fifty-two days.","16":"When all our enemies heard about it, and all the nations surrounding us saw it, they lost their confidence; for they realized that this work had been accomplished with the help of our God.","17":"Also in those days many letters went from the nobles of Judah to Tobiah, and Tobiah’s letters came to them.","18":"For many in Judah were bound by oath to him because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.","19":"Moreover, they were speaking about his good deeds in my presence, and were reporting my words to him. Then Tobiah sent letters to frighten me."},"7":{"1":"Now when the wall was rebuilt and I had installed the doors, and the gatekeepers, the singers, and the Levites were appointed,","2":"then I put Hanani my brother, and Hananiah the commander of the citadel, in charge of Jerusalem, for he was a faithful man and feared God more than many.","3":"Then I said to them, “The gates of Jerusalem are not to be opened until the sun is hot, and while they are standing guard, the gatekeepers are to keep the doors shut and bolted.

out cisterns, vineyards, olive groves,\nFruit trees in abundance.\nSo they ate, were filled and put on fat,\nAnd lived luxuriously in Your great goodness.","26":"“But they became rebellious and

And Esther was finding favor in the eyes of all who saw her.","16":"So Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus in his royal palace in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.","17":"The king loved Esther more than all the women, and she found favor and kindness with him more than all the virgins, so that he set the royal turban on her head and made her queen in place of Vashti.","18":"Then the king held a great banquet, Esther’s banquet, for all his officials and his servants; he also made a holiday for the provinces and gave gifts in proportion to the king’s bounty.","19":"Now when the virgins were gathered together for the second time, then Mordecai was sitting at the king’s gate.","20":"Esther still had not revealed her relatives or her people, just as Mordecai had instructed her; for Esther did what Mordecai told her just as she had when under his care.","21":"In those days, while Mordecai was sitting at the king’s gate, Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king’s officials from those who guarded the door, became angry and sought to attack King Ahasuerus.","22":"But the plot became known to Mordecai and he informed Queen Esther, and Esther told the king in Mordecai’s name.","23":"Then when the plot was investigated and found to be so, they were both hanged on a wooden gallows; and it was written in the Book of the Chronicles in the king’s presence."},"3":{"1":"After these events King Ahasuerus honored Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and promoted him and established his authority over all the officials who were with him.","2":"All the king’s servants who were at the king’s gate bowed down and paid homage to Haman; for so the king had commanded regarding him. But Mordecai neither bowed down nor paid homage.","3":"Then the king’s servants who were at the king’s gate said to Mordecai, “Why are you violating the king’s command?”","4":"Now it was when they had spoken daily to him and he would not listen to them, that they told Haman to see whether Mordecai’s reason would stand; for he had told them that he was a Jew.","5":"When Haman saw that Mordecai neither bowed down nor paid homage to him, Haman was filled with rage.","6":"But he considered it beneath his dignity to kill Mordecai alone, for they had told him who the people of Mordecai were; so Haman sought to annihilate all the Jews, the people of Mordecai, who were found throughout the kingdom of Ahasuerus.","7":"In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, Pur, that is the lot, was cast before Haman from day to day and from month to month, until the twelfth month, that is the month Adar.","8":"Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus, “There is a certain people scattered and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom; their laws are different from those of all other people and they do not comply with the king’s laws, so it is not in the king’s interest to let them remain.","9":"“If it is pleasing to the king, let it be decreed that they be eliminated, and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who carry out the king’s business, to put into the king’s treasuries.”","10":"Then the king took his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews.","11":"And the king said to Haman, “The silver is yours, and the people also, to do with them as you please.”","12":"Then the king’s scribes were summoned on the thirteenth day of the first month, and it was written just as Haman commanded to the king’s satraps, to the governors who were over each province and to the officials of each people, each province according to its script, each people according to its language, being written in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed with the king’s signet ring.","13":"Letters were sent by couriers to all the king’s provinces to annihilate, kill, and destroy all the Jews, both young and old, women and children, in one day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to seize their possessions as plunder.","14":"A copy of the edict to be issued as law in every province was published to all the peoples so that they would be ready for this day.","15":"The couriers went out, speeded by the king’s order while the decree was issued at the citadel in Susa; and while the king and Haman sat down to drink, the city of Susa was agitated."},"4":{"1":"When Mordecai learned of everything that had been done, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and ashes, and went out into the midst of the city and wailed loudly and bitterly.","2":"And he came as far as the king’s gate, for no one was to enter the king’s gate clothed in sackcloth.","3":"In each and every province where the command and decree of the king came, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting, weeping, and mourning rites; and many had sackcloth and ashes spread out as a bed.","4":"Then Esther’s attendants and her eunuchs came and informed her, and the queen was seized by great fear. And she sent garments to clothe Mordecai so that he would remove his sackcloth from him, but he did not accept them.","5":"Then Esther summoned Hathach from the king’s eunuchs, whom the king had appointed to attend her, and ordered him to go to Mordecai to learn what this mourning was and why it was happening.","6":"So Hathach went out to Mordecai in the city square, in front of the king’s gate.","7":"Mordecai told him everything that had happened to him, and the exact amount of money that Haman had promised to pay to the king’s treasuries for the elimination of the Jews.","8":"He also gave him a copy of the text of the edict which had been issued in Susa for their annihilation, so that he might show Esther and inform her, and to order her to go in to the king to implore his favor and plead with him for her people.","9":"So Hathach came back and reported Mordecai’s words to Esther.","10":"Then Esther spoke to Hathach and ordered him to reply to Mordecai:","11":"“All the king’s servants and the people of the king’s provinces know that for any man or woman who comes to the king in the inner courtyard, who is not summoned, he has only one law, that he be put to death, unless the king holds out to him the golden scepter so that he may live. And I have not been summoned to come to the king for these thirty days.”","12":"And they reported Esther’s words to Mordecai.","13":"Then Mordecai told them to reply to Esther, “Do not imagine that you in the king’s palace can escape any more than all the other Jews.","14":"“For if you keep silent at this time, liberation and rescue will arise for the Jews from another place, and you and your father’s house will perish. And who knows whether you have not attained royalty for such a time as this?”","15":"Then Esther told them to reply to Mordecai,","16":"“Go, gather all the Jews who are found in Susa, and fast for me; do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. I and my attendants also will fast in the same way. And then I will go in to the king, which is not in accordance with the law; and if I perish, I perish.”","17":"So Mordecai went away and did just as Esther had commanded him."},"5":{"1":"Now it came about on the third day that Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner courtyard of the king’s palace in front of the king’s rooms, and the king was sitting on his royal throne in the throne room, opposite the entrance to the palace.","2":"When the king saw Esther the queen standing in the courtyard, she obtained favor in his sight; and the king extended to Esther the golden scepter which was in his hand. So Esther approached and touched the top of the scepter.","3":"Then the king said to her, “What is troubling you, Queen Esther? And what is your request? Up to half of the kingdom it shall be given to you.”","4":"Esther said, “If it pleases the king, may the king and Haman come this day to the banquet that I have prepared for him.”","5":"Then the king said, “Bring Haman quickly so that we may do as Esther desires.” So the king and Haman came to the banquet which Esther had prepared.","6":"As they drank their wine at the banquet, the king said to Esther, “What is your request, for it shall be granted to you. And what is your wish? Up to half of the kingdom it shall be done.”","7":"So Esther replied, “My request and my wish is:","8":"if I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it pleases the king to grant my request and do what I wish, may the king and Haman come to the banquet which I will prepare for them, and tomorrow I will do as the king says.”","9":"Then Haman went out that day joyful and pleased of heart; but when Haman saw Mordecai at the king’s gate and that he did not stand up or tremble before him, Haman was filled with anger against Mordecai.","10":"Haman controlled himself, however, and went to his house. But he sent for his friends and his wife Zeresh.","11":"Then Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and his many sons, and every occasion on which the king had honored him and how he had promoted him above the officials and servants of the king.","12":"Haman also said, “Even Esther the queen let no one except me come with the king to the banquet which she had prepared; and tomorrow also I am invited by her with the king.","13":"“Yet all of this does not satisfy me every time I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.”","14":"Then Zeresh his wife and all his friends said to him, “Have a wooden gallows fifty cubits high made, and in the morning ask the king to have Mordecai hanged on it; then go joyfully with the king to the banquet.” And the advice pleased Haman, so he had the wooden gallows made."},"6":{"1":"During that night the king could not sleep, so he gave an order to bring the book of records, the chronicles, and they were read before the king.","2":"And it was found written what Mordecai had reported about Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs who were doorkeepers, that they had sought to attack King Ahasuerus.","3":"Then the king said, “What honor or dignity has been bestowed on Mordecai for this?” And the king’s servants who attended him said, “Nothing has been done for him.”","4":"So the king said, “Who is in the courtyard?” Now Haman had just entered the outer courtyard of the king’s palace in order to speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on the wooden gallows which he had prepared for him.","5":"So the king’s servants said to him, “Behold, Haman is standing in the courtyard.” And the king said, “Have him come in.”","6":"Haman then came in and the king said to him, “What is to be done for the man whom the king desires to honor?” And Haman said to himself, “Whom would the king desire to honor more than me?”","7":"Therefore Haman said to the king, “For the man whom the king desires to honor,","8":"have them bring a royal robe which the king has worn, and the horse on which the king has ridden, and on whose head a royal turban has been placed;","9":"then order them to hand the robe and the horse over to one of the king’s noble officials, and have them dress the man whom the king desires to honor, and lead him on horseback through the city square, and proclaim before him, ‘So it shall be done for the man whom the king desires to honor.’”","10":"Then the king said to Haman, “Quickly, take the robe and the horse just as you have said, and do so for Mordecai the Jew, who is sitting at the king’s gate; do not fail to do anything of all that you have said.”","11":"So Haman took the robe and the horse, and dressed Mordecai, and led him on horseback through the city square, and proclaimed before him, “So it shall be done for the man whom the king desires to honor.”","12":"Then Mordecai returned to the king’s gate, while Haman hurried home, mourning, with his head covered.","13":"And Haman informed Zeresh his wife and all his friends of everything that had happened to him. Then his wise men and Zeresh his wife said to him, “If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is of Jewish origin, you will not prevail over him, but will certainly fall before him.”","14":"While they were still talking with him, the king’s eunuchs arrived and quickly brought Haman to the banquet which Esther had prepared."},"7":{"1":"Now the king and Haman came to drink wine with Esther the queen.","2":"And the king said to Esther on the second day also as they drank their wine at the banquet, “What is your request, Queen Esther? It shall be granted you. And what is your wish? Up to half of the kingdom it shall be done.”","3":"Then Queen Esther replied, “If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it pleases the king, let my life be given me as my request, and my people as my wish;","4":"for we have been sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, killed, and eliminated. Now if we had only been sold as slaves, men and women, I would have kept silent, because the distress would not be sufficient reason to burden the king.”","5":"Then King Ahasuerus asked Queen Esther, “Who is he, and where is he, who would presume to do such a thing?”","6":"And Esther said, “A foe and an enemy is this wicked Haman!” Then Haman became terrified before the king and queen.","7":"The king then got up in his anger from drinking wine and went into the palace garden; but Haman stayed to beg for his life from Queen Esther, for he saw that harm had been determined against him by the king.","8":"Now when the king returned from the palace garden into the place where they had been drinking wine, Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was. Then the king said, “Will he even assault the queen with me in the house?” As the word went out of the king’s mouth, they covered Haman’s face.","9":"Then Harbonah, one of the eunuchs who stood before the king, said, “Indeed, behold, the wooden gallows standing at Haman’s house fifty cubits high, which Haman made for Mordecai who spoke good in behalf of the king!” And the king said, “Hang him on it.”","10":"So they hanged Haman on the wooden gallows which he had prepared for Mordecai, and the king’s anger subsided."},"8":{"1":"On that day King Ahasuerus gave the house of Haman, the enemy of the Jews, to Queen Esther; and Mordecai came before the king, because Esther had disclosed what he was to her.","2":"Then the king took off his signet ring, which he had taken away from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.","3":"Then Esther spoke again to the king, fell at his feet, wept, and pleaded for his compassion to avert the evil scheme of Haman the Agagite and his plot which he had devised against the Jews.","4":"And the king extended the golden scepter to Esther. So Esther got up and stood before the king.","5":"Then she said, “If it pleases the king and if I have found favor before him, and the matter seems proper to the king and I am pleasing in his sight, let it be written to revoke the letters devised by Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to eliminate the Jews who are in all the king’s provinces.","6":"“For how can I endure to see the disaster which will happen to my people, and how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?”","7":"So King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, “Behold, I have given the house of Haman to Esther, and they have hanged him on the wooden gallows because he had reached out with his hand against the Jews.","8":"“Now you write to the Jews as you see fit, in the king’s name, and seal it with the king’s signet ring; for a decree which is written in the name of the king and sealed with the king’s signet ring may not be revoked.”","9":"So the king’s scribes were summoned at that time in the third month (that is, the month Sivan), on the twenty-third day; and it was written in accordance with everything that Mordecai commanded the Jews, the satraps, the governors, and the officials of the provinces which extended from India to Cush, 127 provinces, to every province according to its script, and to every people according to their language, as well as to the Jews according to their script and their language.","10":"He wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus, and sealed it with the king’s signet ring, and sent letters by couriers on horses, riding on royal relay horses, offspring of racing mares.","11":"In the letters the king granted the Jews who were in each and every city the right to assemble and to defend their lives, to destroy, kill, and eliminate the entire army of any people or province which was going to attack them, including children and women, and to plunder their spoils,","12":"on one day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month (that is, the month Adar).","13":"A copy of the edict to be issued as law in each and every province was published to all the peoples, so that the Jews would be ready for this day to avenge themselves on their enemies.","14":"The couriers, hurrying and speeded by the king’s command, left, riding on the royal relay horses; and the decree was issued at the citadel in Susa.","15":"Then Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in a royal robe of violet and white, with a large crown of gold and a garment of fine linen and purple; and the city of Susa shouted and rejoiced.","16":"For the Jews there was light, joy, jubilation, and honor.","17":"In each and every province and in each and every city, wherever the king’s commandment and his decree arrived, there was joy and jubilation for the Jews, a feast and a holiday.

It shall also be done.”","13":"Then Esther said, “If it pleases the king, let tomorrow also be granted to the Jews who are in Susa to do according to the edict of today; and let Haman’s ten sons be hanged on the wooden gallows.”","14":"So the king commanded that it was to be done so; and an edict was issued in Susa, and Haman’s ten sons were hanged.","15":"The Jews who were in Susa assembled also on the fourteenth day of the month Adar and killed three hundred men in Susa, but they did not lay their hands on the plunder.","16":"Now the rest of the Jews who were in the king’s provinces assembled, to defend their lives and rid themselves of their enemies, and to kill seventy-five thousand of those who hated them; but they did not lay their hands on the plunder.","17":"This was done on the thirteenth day of the month Adar, and on the fourteenth day they rested and made it a day of feasting and rejoicing.","18":"But the Jews who were in Susa assembled on the thirteenth and the fourteenth of the same month, and they rested on the fifteenth day and made it a day of feasting and rejoicing.","19":"Therefore the Jews of the rural areas, who live in the rural towns, make the fourteenth day of the month Adar a holiday for rejoicing and feasting and sending portions of food to one another.","20":"Then Mordecai recorded these events, and he sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, both near and far,","21":"obliging them to celebrate the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same month, annually,","22":"because on those days the Jews rid themselves of their enemies, and it was a month which was turned for them from grief into joy, and from mourning into a holiday; that they were to make them days of feasting and rejoicing, and sending portions of food to one another, and gifts to the poor.","23":"So the Jews undertook what they had started to do, and what Mordecai had written to them.","24":"For Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the adversary of all the Jews, had schemed against the Jews to eliminate them, and had cast Pur, that is the lot, to disturb them and eliminate them.","25":"But when it came to the king’s attention, he commanded by letter that his wicked scheme which he had devised against the Jews was to return on his own head, and that he and his sons were to be hanged on the wooden gallows.","26":"Therefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur. And because of the instructions in this letter, both what they had seen in this regard and what had happened to them,","27":"the Jews established and made a custom for themselves, their descendants, and for all those who allied themselves with them, so that they would not fail to celebrate these two days according to their regulation and according to their appointed time annually.","28":"So these days were to be remembered and celebrated throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and these days of Purim were not to be neglected by the Jews, or their memory fade from their descendants.","29":"Then Queen Esther, daughter of Abihail, with Mordecai the Jew, wrote with full authority to confirm this second letter about Purim.","30":"He sent letters to all the Jews, to the 127 provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, namely, words of peace and truth,","31":"to establish these days of Purim at their appointed times, just as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had established for them, and just as they had established for themselves and for their descendants, with instructions for their times of fasting and their mourning.","32":"The command of Esther established these customs for Purim, and it was written in the book."},"10":{"1":"Now King Ahasuerus imposed a tax on the land and the coastlands of the sea.","2":"And every accomplishment of his authority and power, and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai with which the king honored him, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Media and Persia?","3":"For Mordecai the Jew was second only to King Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews and in favor with his many kinsmen, one who sought the good of his people and one who spoke for the welfare of his entire nation."}},"Job":{"1":{"1":"There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and that man was blameless, upright, fearing God and turning away from evil.","2":"Seven sons and three daughters were born to him.","3":"His possessions were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and very many servants; and that man was the greatest of all the men of the east.","4":"His sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each one on his day, and they would send word and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.","5":"When the days of feasting had completed their cycle, Job would send word to them and consecrate them, getting up early in the morning and offering burnt offerings according to the number of them all; for Job said, “Perhaps my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.” Job did so continually.","6":"Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them.","7":"The LORD said to Satan, “From where do you come?” Satan answered the LORD and said, “From roaming about on the earth and walking around on it.”","8":"The LORD said to Satan, “Have you considered My servant Job?

Now if you are able to read the inscription and make its interpretation known to me, you will be clothed with purple and wear a necklace of gold around your neck, and you will have authority as the third ruler in the kingdom.”","17":"Then Daniel replied and said before the king, “Keep your gifts for yourself or give your rewards to someone else; however, I will read the inscription to the king and make the interpretation known to him.","18":"“O king, the Most High God granted sovereignty, greatness, honor, and majesty to Nebuchadnezzar your father.","19":"“Now because of the greatness which He granted him, all the peoples, nations, and populations of all languages trembled and feared in his presence; whomever he wished, he killed, and whomever he wished, he spared alive; and whomever he wished he elevated, and whomever he wished he humbled.","20":"“But when his heart was arrogant and his spirit became so overbearing that he behaved presumptuously, he was deposed from his royal throne, and his dignity was taken away from him.","21":"“He was also driven away from mankind, and his heart was made like that of animals, and his dwelling place was with the wild donkeys. He was given grass to eat like cattle, and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven, until he recognized that the Most High God is ruler over the realm of mankind, and that He sets over it whomever He wishes.","22":"“Yet you, his son, Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, even though you knew all this,","23":"but you have risen up against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of His house before you, and you and your nobles, your wives, and your concubines have been drinking wine out of them; and you have praised the gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood, and stone, which do not see, nor hear, nor understand. But the God in whose hand are your life-breath and all your ways, you have not glorified.","24":"“Then the hand was sent from Him and this inscription was written out.","25":"“Now this is the inscription that was written:\n‘MENĒ, MENĒ, TEKĒL, UPHARSIN.’","26":"“This is the interpretation of the message: ‘MENĒ’—God has numbered your kingdom and put an end to it.","27":"“‘TEKĒL’—you have been weighed on the scales and found deficient.","28":"“‘PERĒS’—your kingdom has been divided and given to the Medes and Persians.”","29":"Then Belshazzar gave orders, and they clothed Daniel with purple and put a necklace of gold around his neck, and issued a proclamation concerning him that he now had authority as the third ruler in the kingdom.","30":"That same night Belshazzar the Chaldean king was killed.","31":"So Darius the Mede received the kingdom at about the age of sixty-two."},"6":{"1":"It pleased Darius to appoint 120 satraps over the kingdom, to be in charge of the whole kingdom,","2":"and over them, three commissioners (of whom Daniel was one), so that these satraps would be accountable to them, and that the king would not suffer loss.","3":"Then this Daniel began distinguishing himself among the commissioners and satraps because he possessed an extraordinary spirit, and the king intended to appoint him over the entire kingdom.","4":"Then the commissioners and satraps began trying to find a ground of accusation against Daniel regarding government affairs; but they could find no ground of accusation or evidence of corruption, because he was trustworthy, and no negligence or corruption was to be found in him.","5":"Then these men said, “We will not find any ground of accusation against this Daniel unless we find it against him regarding the law of his God.”","6":"Then these commissioners and satraps came by agreement to the king and spoke to him as follows: “King Darius, live forever!","7":"“All the commissioners of the kingdom, the prefects and the satraps, the counselors and the governors, have consulted together that the king should establish a statute and enforce an injunction that anyone who offers a prayer to any god or person besides you, O king, for thirty days, shall be thrown into the lions’ den.","8":"“Now, O king, establish the injunction and sign the document so that it will not be changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which may not be revoked.”","9":"Thereupon, King Darius signed the document, that is, the injunction.","10":"Now when Daniel learned that the document was signed, he entered his house (and in his roof chamber he had windows open toward Jerusalem); and he continued kneeling on his knees three times a day, praying and offering praise before his God, just as he had been doing previously.","11":"Then these men came by agreement and found Daniel offering a prayer and imploring favor before his God.","12":"Then they approached and spoke before the king about the king’s injunction: “Did you not sign an injunction that any person who offers a prayer to any god or person besides you, O king, for thirty days, is to be thrown into the lions’ den?” The king replied, “The statement is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which may not be revoked.”","13":"Then they responded and spoke before the king, “Daniel, who is one of the exiles from Judah, pays no attention to you, O king, or to the injunction which you signed, but keeps offering his prayer three times a day.”","14":"Then, as soon as the king heard this statement, he was deeply distressed, and set his mind on rescuing Daniel; and until sunset he kept exerting himself to save him.","15":"Then these men came by agreement to the king and said to the king, “Recognize, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians that no injunction or statute which the king establishes may be changed.”","16":"Then the king gave orders, and Daniel was brought in and thrown into the lions’ den. The king said to Daniel, “Your God whom you continually serve will Himself rescue you.”","17":"And a stone was brought and placed over the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the signet rings of his nobles, so that nothing would be changed regarding Daniel.","18":"Then the king went to his palace and spent the night fasting, and no entertainment was brought before him; and his sleep fled from him.","19":"Then the king got up at dawn, at the break of day, and went in a hurry to the lions’ den.","20":"And when he had come near the den to Daniel, he cried out with a troubled voice. The king began speaking and said to Daniel, “Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you continually serve, been able to rescue you from the lions?”","21":"Then Daniel spoke to the king, “O king, live forever!","22":"“My God sent His angel and shut the lions’ mouths, and they have not harmed me, since I was found innocent before Him; and also toward you, O king, I have committed no crime.”","23":"Then the king was very glad and gave orders for Daniel to be lifted up out of the den. So Daniel was lifted up out of the den, and no injury whatever was found on him, because he had trusted in his God.","24":"The king then gave orders, and they brought those men who had maliciously accused Daniel, and they threw them, their children, and their wives into the lions’ den; and they had not reached the bottom of the den before the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones.","25":"Then Darius the king wrote to all the peoples, nations, and populations of all languages who were living in all the land: “May your peace be great!","26":"“I issue a decree that in all the realm of my kingdom people are to tremble and fear before the God of Daniel;\nFor He is the living God and enduring forever,\nAnd His kingdom is one which will not be destroyed,\nAnd His dominion will be forever.","27":"“He rescues, saves, and performs signs and miracles\nIn heaven and on earth,\nHe who has also rescued Daniel from the power of the lions.”","28":"So this Daniel enjoyed success in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian."},"7":{"1":"In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream and visions in his mind as he lay on his bed; then he wrote the dream down and told the following summary of it.","2":"Daniel said, “I was looking in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven were stirring up the great sea.","3":"“And four great beasts were coming up from the sea, different from one another.","4":"“The first was like a lion but had the wings of an eagle. I kept looking until its wings were plucked, and it was lifted up from the ground and set up on two feet like a man; a human mind also was given to it.","5":"“And behold, another beast, a second one, resembling a bear. And it was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth; and they said this to it: ‘Arise, devour much meat!’","6":"“After this I kept looking, and behold, another one, like a leopard, which had on its back four wings of a bird; the beast also had four heads, and dominion was given to it.","7":"“After this I kept looking in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and extremely strong; and it had large iron teeth. It devoured and crushed, and trampled down the remainder with its feet; and it was different from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns.","8":"“While I was thinking about the horns, behold, another horn, a little one, came up among them, and three of the previous horns were plucked out before it; and behold, this horn possessed eyes like human eyes, and a mouth uttering great boasts.","9":"“I kept looking\nUntil thrones were set up,\nAnd the Ancient of Days took His seat;\nHis garment was white as snow,\nAnd the hair of His head like pure wool.\nHis throne was ablaze with flames,\nIts wheels were a burning fire.","10":"“A river of fire was flowing\nAnd coming out from before Him;\nThousands upon thousands were serving Him,\nAnd myriads upon myriads were standing before Him;\nThe court convened,\nAnd the books were opened.","11":"“Then I kept looking because of the sound of the boastful words which the horn was speaking; I kept looking until the beast was killed, and its body was destroyed and given to the burning fire.","12":"“As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, but an extension of life was granted to them for an appointed period of time.","13":"“I kept looking in the night visions,\nAnd behold, with the clouds of heaven\nOne like a son of man was coming,\nAnd He came up to the Ancient of Days\nAnd was presented before Him.","14":"“And to Him was given dominion,\nHonor, and a kingdom,\nSo that all the peoples, nations, and populations of all languages\nMight serve Him.\nHis dominion is an everlasting dominion\nWhich will not pass away;\nAnd His kingdom is one\nWhich will not be destroyed.","15":"“As for me, Daniel, my spirit was distressed within me, and the visions in my mind kept alarming me.","16":"“I approached one of those who were standing by and began requesting of him the exact meaning of all this. So he told me and made known to me the interpretation of these things:","17":"‘These great beasts, which are four in number, are four kings who will arise from the earth.","18":"‘But the saints of the Highest One will receive the kingdom and take possession of the kingdom forever, for all ages to come.’","19":"“Then I desired to know the exact meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others, exceedingly dreadful, with its teeth of iron and its claws of bronze, and which devoured, crushed, and trampled down the remainder with its feet,","20":"and the meaning of the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn which came up, and before which three of the horns fell, namely, that horn which had eyes and a mouth uttering great boasts, and which was larger in appearance than its associates.","21":"“I kept looking, and that horn was waging war with the saints and prevailing against them,","22":"until the Ancient of Days came and judgment was passed in favor of the saints of the Highest One, and the time arrived when the saints took possession of the kingdom.","23":"“This is what he said: ‘The fourth beast will be a fourth kingdom on the earth which will be different from all the other kingdoms, and will devour the whole earth and trample it down and crush it.","24":"‘As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings will arise; and another will arise after them, and he will be different from the previous ones and will humble three kings.","25":"‘And he will speak against the Most High and wear down the saints of the Highest One, and he will intend to make alterations in times and in law; and they will be handed over to him for a time, times, and half a time.","26":"‘But the court will convene for judgment, and his dominion will be taken away, annihilated and destroyed forever.","27":"‘Then the sovereignty, the dominion, and the greatness of all the kingdoms under the whole heaven will be given to the people of the saints of the Highest One; His kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom, and all the empires will serve and obey Him.’","28":"“At this point the revelation ended. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts were greatly alarming me and my face became pale, but I kept the matter to myself.”"},"8":{"1":"In the third year of the reign of Belshazzar the king, a vision appeared to me, Daniel, subsequent to the one which appeared to me previously.","2":"I looked in the vision, and while I was looking, I was in the citadel of Susa, which is in the province of Elam; and I looked in the vision, and I myself was beside the Ulai Canal.","3":"Then I raised my eyes and looked, and behold, a ram which had two horns was standing in front of the canal. Now the two horns were long, but one was longer than the other, with the longer one coming up last.","4":"I saw the ram butting westward, northward, and southward, and no other beasts could stand against him nor was there anyone to rescue from his power, but he did as he pleased and made himself great.","5":"While I was observing, behold, a male goat was coming from the west over the surface of the entire earth without touching the ground; and the goat had a prominent horn between his eyes.","6":"He came up to the ram that had the two horns, which I had seen standing in front of the canal, and rushed at him in his mighty wrath.","7":"And I saw him come up beside the ram, and he was enraged at him; and he struck the ram and smashed his two horns, and the ram had no strength to withstand him. So he hurled him to the ground and trampled on him, and there was no one to rescue the ram from his power.","8":"Then the male goat made himself exceedingly great. But once he became powerful, the large horn was broken; and in its place four prominent horns came up toward the four winds of heaven.","9":"And out of one of them came a rather small horn which grew exceedingly great toward the south, toward the east, and toward the Beautiful Land.","10":"It grew up to the heavenly lights, and some of the lights, that is, some of the stars it threw down to the earth, and it trampled them.","11":"It even exalted itself to be equal with the Commander of the army; and it removed the regular sacrifice from Him, and the place of His sanctuary was overthrown.","12":"And because of an offense the army will be given to the horn along with the regular sacrifice; and it will hurl truth to the ground and do as it pleases and be successful.","13":"Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to that particular one who was speaking, “How long will the vision about the regular sacrifice apply, while the offense causes horror, so as to allow both the sanctuary and the army to be trampled?”","14":"And he said to me, “For 2,300 evenings and mornings; then the sanctuary will be properly restored.”","15":"When I, Daniel, had seen the vision, I sought to understand it; and behold, standing before me was one who looked like a man.","16":"And I heard the voice of a man between the banks of Ulai, and he called out and said, “Gabriel, explain the vision to this man.”","17":"So he came near to where I was standing, and when he came I was frightened and fell on my face; and he said to me, “Son of man, understand that the vision pertains to the time of the end.”","18":"Now while he was talking with me, I was dazed with my face to the ground; but he touched me and made me stand at my place.","19":"And he said, “Behold, I am going to inform you of what will occur at the final period of the indignation, because it pertains to the appointed time of the end.","20":"“The ram which you saw with the two horns represents the kings of Media and Persia.","21":"“The shaggy goat represents the kingdom of Greece, and the large horn that is between his eyes is the first king.","22":"“The broken horn and the four horns that came up in its place represent four kingdoms which will arise from his nation, although not with his power.","23":"“And in the latter period of their dominion,\nWhen the wrongdoers have run their course,\nA king will arise,\nInsolent and skilled in intrigue.","24":"“And his power will be mighty, but not by his own power,\nAnd he will destroy to an extraordinary degree\nAnd be successful and do as he pleases;\nHe will destroy mighty men and the holy people.","25":"“And through his shrewdness\nHe will make deceit a success by his influence;\nAnd he will make himself great in his own mind,\nAnd he will destroy many while they are at ease.\nHe will even oppose the Prince of princes,\nBut he will be broken without human agency.","26":"“And the vision of the evenings and mornings\nWhich has been told is true;\nBut as for you, keep the vision secret,\nBecause it pertains to many days in the future.”","27":"Then I, Daniel, was exhausted and sick for days.

Is it not brought to be put on the lampstand?","22":"“For nothing is hidden, except to be revealed; nor has anything been secret, but that it would come to light.","23":"“If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.”","24":"And He was saying to them, “Take care what you listen to. By your standard of measure it will be measured to you; and more will be given you besides.","25":"“For whoever has, to him more will be given; and whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.”","26":"And He was saying, “The kingdom of God is like a man who casts seed upon the soil;","27":"and he goes to bed at night and gets up daily, and the seed sprouts and grows—how, he himself does not know.","28":"“The soil produces crops by itself; first the stalk, then the head, then the mature grain in the head.","29":"“Now when the crop permits, he immediately puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.”","30":"And He was saying, “How shall we picture the kingdom of God, or by what parable shall we present it?","31":"“It is like a mustard seed, which, when sown upon the soil, though it is the smallest of all the seeds that are upon the soil,","32":"yet when it is sown, it grows up and becomes larger than all the garden plants, and forms large branches, with the result that THE BIRDS OF THE SKY can NEST UNDER its shade.”","33":"And with many such parables He was speaking the word to them, so far as they were able to understand it;","34":"and He did not speak to them without a parable; but He was explaining everything privately to His own disciples.","35":"On that day, when evening came, He *said to them, “Let’s go over to the other side.”","36":"After dismissing the crowd, they *took Him along with them in the boat, just as He was; and other boats were with Him.","37":"And a fierce gale of wind *developed, and the waves were breaking over the boat so much that the boat was already filling with water.","38":"And yet Jesus Himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion; and they *woke Him and *said to Him, “Teacher, do You not care that we are perishing?”","39":"And He got up and rebuked the wind and said to the sea, “Hush, be still.” And the wind died down and it became perfectly calm.","40":"And He said to them, “Why are you afraid?

Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and the leaven of Herod.”","16":"And they began to discuss with one another the fact that they had no bread.","17":"And Jesus, aware of this, *said to them, “Why are you discussing the fact that you have no bread?

And some people *brought a man who was blind to Jesus and *begged Him to touch him.","23":"Taking the man who was blind by the hand, He brought him out of the village; and after spitting in his eyes and laying His hands on him, He asked him, “Do you see anything?”","24":"And he looked up and said, “I see people, for I see them like trees, walking around.”","25":"Then again He laid His hands on his eyes; and he looked intently and was restored, and began to see everything clearly.","26":"And He sent him to his home, saying, “Do not even enter the village.”","27":"Jesus went out, along with His disciples, to the villages of Caesarea Philippi; and on the way He questioned His disciples, saying to them, “Who do people say that I am?”","28":"They told Him, saying, “John the Baptist; and others say Elijah; and others, one of the prophets.”","29":"And He continued questioning them: “But who do you say that I am?” Peter answered and *said to Him, “You are the Christ.”","30":"And He warned them to tell no one about Him.","31":"And He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise from the dead.","32":"And He was stating the matter plainly.

The twelve were with Him,","2":"and also some women who had been healed of evil spirits and sicknesses: Mary who was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out,","3":"and Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod’s steward, and Susanna, and many others who were contributing to their support out of their private means.","4":"Now when a large crowd was coming together, and those from the various cities were journeying to Him, He spoke by way of a parable:","5":"“The sower went out to sow his seed; and as he sowed, some fell beside the road, and it was trampled underfoot, and the birds of the sky ate it up.","6":"“Other seed fell on rocky soil, and when it came up, it withered away because it had no moisture.","7":"“Other seed fell among the thorns; and the thorns grew up with it and choked it out.","8":"“And yet other seed fell into the good soil, and grew up, and produced a crop a hundred times as much.” As He said these things, He would call out, “The one who has ears to hear, let him hear.”","9":"Now His disciples began asking Him what this parable meant.","10":"And He said, “To you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest they are told in parables, so that while seeing they may not see, and while hearing they may not understand.","11":"“Now this is the parable: the seed is the word of God.","12":"“And those beside the road are the ones who have heard, then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart, so that they will not believe and be saved.","13":"“Those on the rocky soil are the ones who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and yet these do not have a firm root; they believe for a while, and in a time of temptation they fall away.","14":"“And the seed which fell among the thorns, these are the ones who have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked by worries, riches, and pleasures of this life, and they bring no fruit to maturity.","15":"“But the seed in the good soil, these are the ones who have heard the word with a good and virtuous heart, and hold it firmly, and produce fruit with perseverance.","16":"“Now no one lights a lamp and covers it over with a container, or puts it under a bed; but he puts it on a lampstand so that those who come in may see the light.","17":"“For nothing is concealed that will not become evident, nor anything hidden that will not be known and come to light.","18":"“So take care how you listen; for whoever has, to him more will be given; and whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken away from him.”","19":"Now His mother and brothers came to Him, and they were unable to get to Him because of the crowd.","20":"And it was reported to Him, “Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, wishing to see You.”","21":"But He answered and said to them, “My mother and My brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it.”","22":"Now on one of those days Jesus and His disciples got into a boat, and He said to them, “Let’s cross over to the other side of the lake.” So they launched out.","23":"But as they were sailing along He fell asleep; and a fierce gale of wind descended on the lake, and they began to be swamped and to be in danger.","24":"They came up to Jesus and woke Him, saying, “Master, Master, we are perishing!” And He got up and rebuked the wind and the surging waves, and they stopped, and it became calm.","25":"And He said to them, “Where is your faith?” But they were fearful and amazed, saying to one another, “Who then is this, that He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey Him?”","26":"Then they sailed to the country of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee.","27":"And when He stepped out onto the land, a man from the city met Him who was possessed with demons; and he had not put on clothing for a long time and was not living in a house, but among the tombs.","28":"And seeing Jesus, he cried out and fell down before Him, and said with a loud voice, “What business do You have with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg You, do not torment me!”","29":"For He had already commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For it had seized him many times; and he was bound with chains and shackles and kept under guard, and yet he would break the restraints and be driven by the demon into the desert.","30":"And Jesus asked him, “What is your name?” And he said, “Legion”; because many demons had entered him.","31":"And they were begging Him not to command them to go away into the abyss.","32":"Now there was a herd of many pigs feeding there on the mountain; and the demons begged Him to permit them to enter the pigs. And He gave them permission.","33":"And the demons came out of the man and entered the pigs; and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.","34":"Now when the herdsmen saw what had happened, they ran away and reported everything in the city, and in the country.","35":"And the people came out to see what had happened; and they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting down at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind; and they became frightened.","36":"Those who had seen everything reported to them how the man who had been demon-possessed had been made well.","37":"And all the people of the territory of the Gerasenes and the surrounding region asked Him to leave them, because they were overwhelmed by great fear; and He got into a boat and returned.","38":"But the man from whom the demons had gone out was begging Him that he might accompany Him; but Jesus sent him away, saying,","39":"“Return to your home and describe what great things God has done for you.” So he went away, proclaiming throughout the city what great things Jesus had done for him.","40":"And as Jesus was returning, the people welcomed Him, for they had all been waiting for Him.","41":"And a man named Jairus came, and he was an official of the synagogue; and he fell at Jesus’ feet, and began urging Him to come to his house;","42":"for he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was dying. But as He went, the crowds were pressing against Him.","43":"And a woman who had suffered a chronic flow of blood for twelve years, and could not be healed by anyone,","44":"came up behind Him and touched the fringe of His cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped.","45":"And Jesus said, “Who is the one who touched Me?” And while they were all denying it, Peter said, “Master, the people are crowding and pressing in on You.”","46":"But Jesus said, “Someone did touch Me, for I was aware that power had left Me.”","47":"Now when the woman saw that she had not escaped notice, she came trembling and fell down before Him, and admitted in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched Him, and how she had been immediately healed.","48":"And He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace.”","49":"While He was still speaking, someone *came from the house of the synagogue official, saying, “Your daughter has died; do not trouble the Teacher anymore.”","50":"But when Jesus heard this, He responded to him, “Do not be afraid any longer; only believe, and she will be made well.”","51":"When He came to the house, He did not allow anyone to enter with Him except Peter, John, and James, and the girl’s father and mother.","52":"Now they were all weeping and mourning for her; but He said, “Stop weeping, for she has not died, but is asleep.”","53":"And they began laughing at Him, knowing that she had died.","54":"He, however, took her by the hand and spoke forcefully, saying, “Child, arise!”","55":"And her spirit returned, and she got up immediately; and He ordered that something be given her to eat.","56":"Her parents were amazed; but He instructed them to tell no one what had happened."},"9":{"1":"Now He called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all the demons, and the power to heal diseases.","2":"And He sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to perform healing.","3":"And He said to them, “Take nothing for your journey, neither a staff, nor a bag, nor bread, nor money; and do not even have two tunics.","4":"“And whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave that city.","5":"“And as for all who do not receive you, when you leave that city, shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them.”","6":"And as they were leaving, they began going throughout the villages, preaching the gospel and healing everywhere.","7":"Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was happening; and he was greatly perplexed, because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead,","8":"and by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the prophets of old had risen.","9":"Herod said, “I myself had John beheaded; but who is this Man about whom I hear such things?” And he kept trying to see Him.","10":"When the apostles returned, they gave an account to Him of all that they had done. And taking them with Him, He withdrew privately to a city called Bethsaida.","11":"But the crowds were aware of this and followed Him; and He welcomed them and began speaking to them about the kingdom of God, and curing those who had need of healing.","12":"Now the day was ending, and the twelve came up and said to Him, “Dismiss the crowd, so that they may go into the surrounding villages and countryside and find lodging and get something to eat; because here, we are in a secluded place.”","13":"But He said to them, “You give them something to eat!” But they said, “We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless perhaps we go and buy food for all these people.”","14":"(For there were about five thousand men.) But He said to His disciples, “Have them recline to eat in groups of about fifty each.”","15":"They did so, and had them all recline.","16":"And He took the five loaves and the two fish, and, looking up to heaven, He blessed them and broke them, and gave them to the disciples again and again, to serve the crowd.","17":"And they all ate and were satisfied; and the broken pieces which they had left over were picked up, twelve baskets full.","18":"And it happened that while He was praying alone, the disciples were with Him, and He questioned them, saying, “Who do the people say that I am?”","19":"They answered and said, “John the Baptist, and others say Elijah; but others, that one of the prophets of old has risen.”","20":"And He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” And Peter answered and said, “The Christ of God.”","21":"But He warned them and instructed them not to tell this to anyone,","22":"saying, “The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed and be raised on the third day.”","23":"And He was saying to them all, “If anyone wants to come after Me, he must deny himself, take up his cross daily, and follow Me.","24":"“For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake, this is the one who will save it.","25":"“For what good does it do a person if he gains the whole world, but loses or forfeits himself?","26":"“For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when He comes in His glory and the glory of the Father and the holy angels.","27":"“But I say to you truthfully, there are some of those standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God.”","28":"About eight days after these sayings, He took along Peter, John, and James, and went up on the mountain to pray.","29":"And while He was praying, the appearance of His face became different, and His clothing became white and gleaming.","30":"And behold, two men were talking with Him; and they were Moses and Elijah,","31":"who, appearing in glory, were speaking of His departure, which He was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.","32":"Now Peter and his companions had been overcome with sleep; but when they were fully awake, they saw His glory and the two men who were standing with Him.","33":"And as these two men were leaving Him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good that we are here; and let’s make three tabernacles: one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah”—not realizing what he was saying.","34":"But while he was saying this, a cloud formed and began to overshadow them; and they were afraid as they entered the cloud.","35":"And then a voice came from the cloud, saying, “This is My Son, My Chosen One; listen to Him!”","36":"And when the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent, and reported to no one in those days any of the things which they had seen.","37":"On the next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met Him.","38":"And a man from the crowd shouted, saying, “Teacher, I beg You to look at my son, because he is my only son,","39":"and a spirit seizes him and he suddenly screams, and it throws him into a convulsion with foaming at the mouth; and only with difficulty does it leave him, mauling him as it leaves.","40":"“And I begged Your disciples to cast it out, and they could not.”","41":"And Jesus answered and said, “You unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and put up with you? Bring your son here.”","42":"Now while he was still approaching, the demon slammed him to the ground and threw him into a convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy and gave him back to his father.","43":"And they were all amazed at the greatness of God.\nBut while everyone was astonished at all that He was doing, He said to His disciples,","44":"“As for you, let these words sink into your ears: for the Son of Man is going to be handed over to men.”","45":"But they did not understand this statement, and it was concealed from them so that they would not comprehend it; and they were afraid to ask Him about this statement.","46":"Now an argument started among them as to which of them might be the greatest.","47":"But Jesus, knowing what they were thinking in their hearts, took a child and had him stand by His side,","48":"and He said to them, “Whoever receives this child in My name receives Me, and whoever receives Me receives Him who sent Me; for the one who is least among all of you, this is the one who is great.”","49":"John answered and said, “Master, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name; and we tried to prevent him, because he does not follow along with us.”","50":"But Jesus said to him, “Do not hinder him; for the one who is not against you is for you.”","51":"When the days were approaching for His ascension, He was determined to go to Jerusalem;","52":"and He sent messengers on ahead of Him, and they went and entered a village of the Samaritans to make arrangements for Him.","53":"And they did not receive Him, because He was traveling toward Jerusalem.","54":"When His disciples James and John saw this, they said, “Lord, do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?”","55":"But He turned and rebuked them.","56":"And they went on to another village.","57":"As they were going on the road, someone said to Him, “I will follow You wherever You go.”","58":"And Jesus said to him, “The foxes have holes and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.”","59":"And He said to another, “Follow Me.” But he said, “Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father.”","60":"But He said to him, “Allow the dead to bury their own dead; but as for you, go and proclaim everywhere the kingdom of God.”","61":"Another also said, “I will follow You, Lord; but first permit me to say goodbye to those at my home.”","62":"But Jesus said to him, “No one, after putting his hand to the plow and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.”"},"10":{"1":"Now after this the Lord appointed seventy-two others, and sent them in pairs ahead of Him to every city and place where He Himself was going to come.","2":"And He was saying to them, “The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; therefore plead with the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest.","3":"“Go; behold, I am sending you out like lambs in the midst of wolves.","4":"“Carry no money belt, no bag, no sandals, and greet no one along the way.","5":"“And whatever house you enter, first say, ‘Peace be to this house.’","6":"“And if a man of peace is there, your peace will rest upon him; but if not, it will return to you.","7":"“Stay in that house, eating and drinking what they provide; for the laborer is deserving of his wages. Do not move from house to house.","8":"“Whatever city you enter and they receive you, eat what is served to you;","9":"and heal those in it who are sick, and say to them, ‘The kingdom of God has come near to you.’","10":"“But whatever city you enter and they do not receive you, go out into its streets and say,","11":"‘Even the dust of your city which clings to our feet we wipe off in protest against you; yet be sure of this, that the kingdom of God has come near.’","12":"“I say to you, it will be more tolerable on that day for Sodom than for that city.","13":"“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that occurred in you had occurred in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.","14":"“But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you.","15":"“And you, Capernaum, will not be exalted to heaven, will you? You will be brought down to Hades!","16":"“The one who listens to you listens to Me, and the one who rejects you rejects Me; but the one who rejects Me rejects the One who sent Me.”","17":"Now the seventy-two returned with joy, saying, “Lord, even the demons are subject to us in Your name!”","18":"And He said to them, “I watched Satan fall from heaven like lightning.","19":"“Behold, I have given you authority to walk on snakes and scorpions, and authority over all the power of the enemy, and nothing will injure you.","20":"“Nevertheless, do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are recorded in heaven.”","21":"At that very time He rejoiced greatly in the Holy Spirit, and said, “I praise You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants. Yes, Father, for doing so was well pleasing in Your sight.","22":"“All things have been handed over to Me by My Father, and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son determines to reveal Him.”","23":"Turning to the disciples, He said privately, “Blessed are the eyes that see the things you see;","24":"for I tell you that many prophets and kings wanted to see the things that you see, and did not see them, and to hear the things that you hear, and did not hear them.”","25":"And behold, a lawyer stood up and put Him to the test, saying, “Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?”","26":"And He said to him, “What is written in the Law? How does it read to you?”","27":"And he answered, “YOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART, AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND WITH ALL YOUR STRENGTH, AND WITH ALL YOUR MIND; AND YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF.”","28":"And He said to him, “You have answered correctly; do this and you will live.”","29":"But wanting to justify himself, he said to Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?”","30":"Jesus replied and said, “A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he encountered robbers, and they stripped him and beat him, and went away leaving him half dead.","31":"“And by coincidence a priest was going down on that road, and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.","32":"“Likewise a Levite also, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.","33":"“But a Samaritan who was on a journey came upon him; and when he saw him, he felt compassion,","34":"and came to him and bandaged up his wounds, pouring oil and wine on them; and he put him on his own animal, and brought him to an inn and took care of him.","35":"“On the next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper and said, ‘Take care of him; and whatever more you spend, when I return, I will repay you.’","36":"“Which of these three do you think proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell into the robbers’ hands?”","37":"And he said, “The one who showed compassion to him.” Then Jesus said to him, “Go and do the same.”","38":"Now as they were traveling along, He entered a village; and a woman named Martha welcomed Him into her home.","39":"And she had a sister called Mary, who was also seated at the Lord’s feet, and was listening to His word.","40":"But Martha was distracted with all her preparations; and she came up to Him and said, “Lord, do You not care that my sister has left me to do the serving by myself? Then tell her to help me.”","41":"But the Lord answered and said to her, “Martha, Martha, you are worried and distracted by many things;","42":"but only one thing is necessary; for Mary has chosen the good part, which shall not be taken away from her.”"},"11":{"1":"It happened that while Jesus was praying in a certain place, when He had finished, one of His disciples said to Him, “Lord, teach us to pray, just as John also taught his disciples.”","2":"And He said to them, “When you pray, say:\n‘Father, hallowed be Your name.\nYour kingdom come.","3":"‘Give us each day our daily bread.","4":"‘And forgive us our sins,\nFor we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us.\nAnd do not lead us into temptation.’”","5":"And He said to them, “Suppose one of you has a friend, and goes to him at midnight and says to him, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves,","6":"because a friend of mine has come to me from a journey and I have nothing to serve him’;","7":"and from inside he answers and says, ‘Do not bother me; the door has already been shut and my children and I are in bed; I cannot get up and give you anything.’","8":"“I tell you, even if he will not get up and give him anything just because he is his friend, yet because of his shamelessness he will get up and give him as much as he needs.","9":"“So I say to you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.","10":"“For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks, it will be opened.","11":"“Now which one of you fathers will his son ask for a fish, and instead of a fish, he will give him a snake?","12":"“Or he will even ask for an egg, and his father will give him a scorpion?","13":"“So if you, despite being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him?”","14":"And He was casting out a mute demon; when the demon had gone out, the man who was previously unable to speak talked, and the crowds were amazed.","15":"But some of them said, “He casts out the demons by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons.”","16":"Others, to test Him, were demanding of Him a sign from heaven.","17":"But He knew their thoughts and said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste; and a house divided against itself falls.","18":"“And if Satan also has been divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand?

sell all that you possess and distribute the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me.”","23":"But when he had heard these things, he became very sad, for he was extremely wealthy.","24":"And Jesus looked at him and said, “How hard it is for those who are wealthy to enter the kingdom of God!","25":"“For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God!”","26":"Those who heard Him said, “And so who can be saved?”","27":"But He said, “The things that are impossible with people are possible with God.”","28":"Peter said, “Behold, we have left our own homes and followed You.”","29":"And He said to them, “Truly I say to you, there is no one who has left house, or wife, or brothers, or parents, or children for the sake of the kingdom of God,","30":"who will not receive many times as much at this time, and in the age to come, eternal life.”","31":"Now He took the twelve aside and said to them, “Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all the things that have been written through the prophets about the Son of Man will be accomplished.","32":"“For He will be handed over to the Gentiles, and will be ridiculed, and abused, and spit upon,","33":"and after they have flogged Him, they will kill Him; and on the third day He will rise.”","34":"The disciples understood none of these things, and the meaning of this statement was hidden from them, and they did not comprehend the things that were said.","35":"Now as Jesus was approaching Jericho, a man who was blind was sitting by the road, begging.","36":"But when he heard a crowd going by, he began inquiring what this was.","37":"They told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.","38":"And he called out, saying, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”","39":"Those who led the way were sternly telling him to be quiet; but he kept crying out all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”","40":"And Jesus stopped and commanded that he be brought to Him; and when he came near, He asked him,","41":"“What do you want Me to do for you?” And he said, “Lord, I want to regain my sight!”","42":"And Jesus said to him, “Regain your sight; your faith has made you well.”","43":"And immediately he regained his sight and began following Him, glorifying God; and when all the people saw it, they gave praise to God."},"19":{"1":"Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through.","2":"And there was a man called by the name of Zaccheus; he was a chief tax collector and he was rich.","3":"Zaccheus was trying to see who Jesus was, and he was unable due to the crowd, because he was short in stature.","4":"So he ran on ahead and climbed up a sycamore tree in order to see Him, because He was about to pass through that way.","5":"And when Jesus came to the place, He looked up and said to him, “Zaccheus, hurry and come down, for today I must stay at your house.”","6":"And he hurried and came down, and received Him joyfully.","7":"When the people saw this, they all began to complain, saying, “He has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner!”","8":"But Zaccheus stopped and said to the Lord, “Behold, Lord, half of my possessions I am giving to the poor, and if I have extorted anything from anyone, I am giving back four times as much.”","9":"And Jesus said to him, “Today salvation has come to this house, because he, too, is a son of Abraham.","10":"“For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost.”","11":"Now while they were listening to these things, Jesus went on to tell a parable, because He was near Jerusalem and they thought that the kingdom of God was going to appear immediately.","12":"So He said, “A nobleman went to a distant country to receive a kingdom for himself, and then to return.","13":"“And he called ten of his own slaves and gave them ten minas, and said to them, ‘Do business with this money until I come back.’","14":"“But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, ‘We do not want this man to reign over us.’","15":"“When he returned after receiving the kingdom, he ordered that these slaves, to whom he had given the money, be summoned to him so that he would learn how much they had made by the business they had done.","16":"“The first slave appeared, saying, ‘Master, your mina has made ten minas more.’","17":"“And he said to him, ‘Well done, good slave; since you have been faithful in a very little thing, you are to have authority over ten cities.’","18":"“The second one came, saying, ‘Your mina, master, has made five minas.’","19":"“And he said to him also, ‘And you are to be over five cities.’","20":"“And then another came, saying, ‘Master, here is your mina, which I kept tucked away in a handkerchief;","21":"for I was afraid of you, because you are a demanding man; you take up what you did not lay down, and reap what you did not sow.’","22":"“He *said to him, ‘From your own lips I will judge you, you worthless slave. Did you know that I am a demanding man, taking up what I did not lay down, and reaping what I did not sow?","23":"‘And so why did you not put my money in the bank, and when I came back, I would have collected it with interest?’","24":"“And then he said to the other slaves who were present, ‘Take the mina away from him and give it to the one who has the ten minas.’","25":"“And they said to him, ‘Master, he already has ten minas.’","26":"‘I tell you that to everyone who has, more shall be given, but from the one who does not have, even what he does have shall be taken away.","27":"‘But as for these enemies of mine who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and slaughter them in my presence.’”","28":"After Jesus said these things, He was going on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.","29":"When He approached Bethphage and Bethany, near the mountain that is called Olivet, He sent two of the disciples,","30":"saying, “Go into the village ahead of you; there, as you enter, you will find a colt tied, on which no one yet has ever sat; untie it and bring it here.","31":"“And if anyone asks you, ‘Why are you untying it?’ you shall say this: ‘The Lord has need of it.’”","32":"So those who were sent left and found it just as He had told them.","33":"And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, “Why are you untying the colt?”","34":"They said, “The Lord has need of it.”","35":"And they brought it to Jesus, and they threw their cloaks on the colt and put Jesus on it.","36":"Now as He was going, they were spreading their cloaks on the road.","37":"And as soon as He was approaching, near the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of the disciples began to praise God joyfully with a loud voice for all the miracles which they had seen,","38":"shouting:\n“BLESSED IS the King, THE ONE WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD;\nPeace in heaven and glory in the highest!”","39":"And yet some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Him, “Teacher, rebuke Your disciples!”","40":"Jesus replied, “I tell you, if these stop speaking, the stones will cry out!”","41":"When He approached Jerusalem, He saw the city and wept over it,","42":"saying, “If you had known on this day, even you, the conditions for peace! But now they have been hidden from your eyes.","43":"“For the days will come upon you when your enemies will put up a barricade against you, and surround you and hem you in on every side,","44":"and they will level you to the ground, and throw down your children within you, and they will not leave in you one stone upon another, because you did not recognize the time of your visitation.”","45":"And Jesus entered the temple grounds and began to drive out those who were selling,","46":"saying to them, “It is written: ‘AND MY HOUSE WILL BE A HOUSE OF PRAYER,’ but you have made it a DEN OF ROBBERS.”","47":"And He was teaching daily in the temple; but the chief priests and the scribes and the leading men among the people were trying to put Him to death,","48":"and yet they could not find anything that they might do, for all the people were hanging on to every word He said."},"20":{"1":"On one of the days while He was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes with the elders confronted Him,","2":"and they declared, saying to Him, “Tell us by what authority You are doing these things, or who is the one who gave You this authority?”","3":"But He replied to them, “I will also ask you a question, and you tell Me:","4":"“Was the baptism of John from heaven or from men?”","5":"They discussed among themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ He will say, ‘Why did you not believe him?’","6":"“But if we say, ‘From men,’ all the people will stone us to death, since they are convinced that John was a prophet.”","7":"And so they answered that they did not know where it came from.","8":"And Jesus said to them, “Neither am I telling you by what authority I do these things.”","9":"But He began to tell the people this parable: “A man planted a vineyard and leased it to vine-growers, and went on a journey for a long time.","10":"“At the harvest time he sent a slave to the vine-growers, so that they would give him his share of the produce of the vineyard; but the vine-growers beat him and sent him away empty-handed.","11":"“And he proceeded to send another slave; but they beat him also and treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty-handed.","12":"“And he proceeded to send a third; but this one too they wounded and threw out.","13":"“Now the owner of the vineyard said, ‘What am I to do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps they will respect him.’","14":"“But when the vine-growers saw him, they discussed with one another, saying, ‘This is the heir; let’s kill him so that the inheritance will be ours.’","15":"“And so they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What, then, will the owner of the vineyard do to them?","16":"“He will come and put these vine-growers to death, and will give the vineyard to others.” However, when they heard this, they said, “May it never happen!”","17":"But Jesus looked at them and said, “Then what is this statement that has been written:\n‘A STONE WHICH THE BUILDERS REJECTED,\nTHIS HAS BECOME THE CHIEF CORNERSTONE’?","18":"“Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; but on whomever it falls, it will crush him.”","19":"The scribes and the chief priests tried to lay hands on Him that very hour, and yet they feared the people; for they were aware that He had spoken this parable against them.","20":"And so they watched Him closely, and sent spies who pretended to be righteous, in order that they might catch Him in some statement, so that they could hand Him over to the jurisdiction and authority of the governor.","21":"And the spies questioned Him, saying, “Teacher, we know that You speak and teach correctly, and You are not partial to anyone, but You teach the way of God on the basis of truth.","22":"“Is it permissible for us to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?”","23":"But He saw through their trickery and said to them,","24":"“Show Me a denarius. Whose image and inscription does it have?” They said, “Caesar’s.”","25":"And He said to them, “Then pay to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”","26":"And they were unable to catch Him in a statement in the presence of the people; and they were amazed at His answer, and said nothing.","27":"Now some of the Sadducees (who maintain that there is no resurrection) came to Him,","28":"and they questioned Him, saying, “Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies, leaving a wife, and he is childless, that his brother is to marry the wife and raise up children for his brother.","29":"“So then, there were seven brothers; and the first took a wife and died childless;","30":"and the second","31":"and the third married her; and in the same way all seven died, leaving no children.","32":"“Finally the woman also died.","33":"“Therefore, in the resurrection, which one’s wife does the woman become? For all seven married her.”","34":"Jesus said to them, “The sons of this age marry and the women are given in marriage,","35":"but those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage;","36":"for they cannot even die anymore, for they are like angels, and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.","37":"“But as for the fact that the dead are raised, even Moses revealed this in the passage about the burning bush, where he calls the Lord THE GOD OF ABRAHAM, THE GOD OF ISAAC, AND THE GOD OF JACOB.","38":"“Now He is not the God of the dead, but of the living; for all live to Him.”","39":"Some of the scribes answered and said, “Teacher, You have spoken well.”","40":"For they did not have the courage to question Him any longer about anything.","41":"But He said to them, “How is it that they say the Christ is David’s son?","42":"“For David himself says in the book of Psalms,\n‘THE LORD SAID TO MY LORD,\n“SIT AT MY RIGHT HAND,","43":"UNTIL I MAKE YOUR ENEMIES A FOOTSTOOL FOR YOUR FEET.”’","44":"“Therefore David calls Him ‘Lord,’ and so how is He his son?”","45":"And while all the people were listening, He said to the disciples,","46":"“Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes, and love personal greetings in the marketplaces, and chief seats in the synagogues and places of honor at banquets,","47":"who devour widows’ houses, and for appearance’s sake offer long prayers. These will receive all the more condemnation.”"},"21":{"1":"Now He looked up and saw the wealthy putting their gifts into the temple treasury.","2":"And He saw a poor widow putting in two lepta coins.","3":"And He said, “Truly I say to you, this poor widow put in more than all of them;","4":"for they all contributed to the offering from their surplus; but she, from her poverty, put in all that she had to live on.”","5":"And while some were talking about the temple, that it was decorated with beautiful stones and vowed gifts, He said,","6":"“As for these things which you are observing, the days will come when there will not be left one stone upon another, which will not be torn down.”","7":"They asked Him questions, saying, “Teacher, when therefore will these things happen? And what will be the sign when these things are about to take place?”","8":"And He said, “See to it that you are not misled; for many will come in My name, saying, ‘I am He,’ and, ‘The time is near.’ Do not go after them.","9":"“And when you hear of wars and revolts, do not be alarmed; for these things must take place first, but the end will not follow immediately.”","10":"Then He continued by saying to them, “Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom,","11":"and there will be massive earthquakes, and in various places plagues and famines; and there will be terrible sights and great signs from heaven.","12":"“But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, turning you over to the synagogues and prisons, bringing you before kings and governors on account of My name.","13":"“It will lead to an opportunity for your testimony.","14":"“So make up your minds not to prepare beforehand to defend yourselves;","15":"for I will provide you eloquence and wisdom which none of your adversaries will be able to oppose or refute.","16":"“But you will be betrayed even by parents, brothers and sisters, other relatives, and friends, and they will put some of you to death,","17":"and you will be hated by all people because of My name.","18":"“And yet not a hair of your head will perish.","19":"“By your endurance you will gain your lives.","20":"“But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then recognize that her desolation is near.","21":"“Then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains, and those who are inside the city must leave, and those who are in the country must not enter the city;","22":"because these are days of punishment, so that all things which have been written will be fulfilled.","23":"“Woe to those women who are pregnant, and to those who are nursing babies in those days;

prepare it there.”","13":"And they left and found everything just as He had told them; and they prepared the Passover.","14":"When the hour came, He reclined at the table, and the apostles with Him.","15":"And He said to them, “I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer;","16":"for I say to you, I shall not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.”","17":"And when He had taken a cup and given thanks, He said, “Take this and share it among yourselves;","18":"for I say to you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine from now on until the kingdom of God comes.”","19":"And when He had taken some bread and given thanks, He broke it and gave it to them, saying, “This is My body, which is being given for you; do this in remembrance of Me.”","20":"And in the same way He took the cup after they had eaten, saying, “This cup, which is poured out for you, is the new covenant in My blood.","21":"“But behold, the hand of the one betraying Me is with Mine on the table.","22":"“For indeed, the Son of Man is going as it has been determined; but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed!”","23":"And they began to debate among themselves which one of them it was who was going to do this.","24":"And a dispute also developed among them as to which one of them was regarded as being the greatest.","25":"And He said to them, “The kings of the Gentiles domineer over them; and those who have authority over them are called ‘Benefactors.’","26":"“But it is not this way for you; rather, the one who is the greatest among you must become like the youngest, and the leader like the servant.","27":"“For who is greater, the one who reclines at the table or the one who serves?

I have found in His case no grounds for a sentence of death; therefore I will punish Him and release Him.”","23":"But they were insistent, with loud voices, demanding that He be crucified. And their voices began to prevail.","24":"And so Pilate decided to have their demand carried out.","25":"And he released the man for whom they were asking, who had been thrown into prison for a revolt and murder; but he handed Jesus over to their will.","26":"And when they led Him away, they seized a man, Simon of Cyrene, as he was coming in from the country, and placed on him the cross to carry behind Jesus.","27":"Now following Him was a large crowd of the people, and of women who were mourning and grieving for Him.","28":"But Jesus turned to them and said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, stop weeping for Me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.","29":"“For behold, days are coming when they will say, ‘Blessed are those who cannot bear, and the wombs that have not given birth, and the breasts that have not nursed.’","30":"“Then they will begin TO SAY TO THE MOUNTAINS, ‘FALL ON US,’ AND TO THE HILLS, ‘COVER US.’","31":"“For if they do these things when the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?”","32":"Now two others, who were criminals, were also being led away to be put to death with Him.","33":"And when they came to the place called The Skull, there they crucified Him and the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left.","34":"But Jesus was saying, “Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing.”] And they cast lots, dividing His garments among themselves.","35":"And the people stood by, watching. And even the rulers were sneering at Him, saying, “He saved others; let Him save Himself if this is the Christ of God, His Chosen One.”","36":"The soldiers also ridiculed Him, coming up to Him, offering Him sour wine,","37":"and saying, “If You are the King of the Jews, save Yourself!”","38":"Now there was also an inscription above Him, “THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.”","39":"One of the criminals who were hanged there was hurling abuse at Him, saying, “Are You not the Christ? Save Yourself and us!”","40":"But the other responded, and rebuking him, said, “Do you not even fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation?","41":"“And we indeed are suffering justly, for we are receiving what we deserve for our crimes; but this Man has done nothing wrong.”","42":"And he was saying, “Jesus, remember me when You come into Your kingdom!”","43":"And He said to him, “Truly I say to you, today you will be with Me in Paradise.”","44":"It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the entire land until the ninth hour,","45":"because the sun stopped shining; and the veil of the temple was torn in two.","46":"And Jesus, crying out with a loud voice, said, “Father, INTO YOUR HANDS I ENTRUST MY SPIRIT.” And having said this, He died.","47":"Now when the centurion saw what had happened, he began praising God, saying, “This Man was in fact innocent.”","48":"And all the crowds who came together for this spectacle, after watching what had happened, began to return home, beating their chests.","49":"And all His acquaintances and the women who accompanied Him from Galilee were standing at a distance, seeing these things.","50":"And a man named Joseph, who was a member of the Council, a good and righteous man","51":"(he had not consented to their plan and action), a man from Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who was waiting for the kingdom of God—","52":"this man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.","53":"And he took it down and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid Him in a tomb cut into the rock, where no one had ever lain.","54":"It was a preparation day, and a Sabbath was about to begin.","55":"Now the women who had come with Him from Galilee followed, and they saw the tomb and how His body was laid.","56":"And then they returned and prepared spices and perfumes.\nAnd on the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment."},"24":{"1":"But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came to the tomb bringing the spices which they had prepared.","2":"And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb,","3":"but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.","4":"While they were perplexed about this, behold, two men suddenly stood near them in gleaming clothing;","5":"and as the women were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, “Why are you seeking the living One among the dead?","6":"“He is not here, but He has risen. Remember how He spoke to you while He was still in Galilee,","7":"saying that the Son of Man must be handed over to sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise from the dead.”","8":"And they remembered His words,","9":"and returned from the tomb and reported all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.","10":"Now these women were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Mary the mother of James; also the other women with them were telling these things to the apostles.","11":"But these words appeared to them as nonsense, and they would not believe the women.","12":"Nevertheless, Peter got up and ran to the tomb; and when he stooped and looked in, he *saw the linen wrappings only; and he went away to his home, marveling at what had happened.","13":"And behold, on that very day two of them were going to a village named Emmaus, which was sixty stadia from Jerusalem.","14":"And they were talking with each other about all these things which had taken place.","15":"While they were talking and discussing, Jesus Himself approached and began traveling with them.","16":"But their eyes were kept from recognizing Him.","17":"And He said to them, “What are these words that you are exchanging with one another as you are walking?” And they came to a stop, looking sad.","18":"One of them, named Cleopas, answered and said to Him, “Are You possibly the only one living near Jerusalem who does not know about the things that happened here in these days?”","19":"And He said to them, “What sort of things?” And they said to Him, “Those about Jesus the Nazarene, who proved to be a prophet mighty in deed and word in the sight of God and all the people,","20":"and how the chief priests and our rulers handed Him over to be sentenced to death, and crucified Him.","21":"“But we were hoping that it was He who was going to redeem Israel. Indeed, besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened.","22":"“But also some women among us left us bewildered. When they were at the tomb early in the morning,","23":"and did not find His body, they came, saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said that He was alive.","24":"“And so some of those who were with us went to the tomb, and found it just exactly as the women also had said; but Him they did not see.”","25":"And then He said to them, “You foolish men and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!","26":"“Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and to come into His glory?”","27":"Then beginning with Moses and with all the Prophets, He explained to them the things written about Himself in all the Scriptures.","28":"And they approached the village where they were going, and He gave the impression that He was going farther.","29":"And so they strongly urged Him, saying, “Stay with us, for it is getting toward evening, and the day is now nearly over.” So He went in to stay with them.","30":"And it came about, when He had reclined at the table with them, that He took the bread and blessed it, and He broke it and began giving it to them.","31":"And then their eyes were opened and they recognized Him; and He vanished from their sight.","32":"They said to one another, “Were our hearts not burning within us when He was speaking to us on the road, while He was explaining the Scriptures to us?”","33":"And they got up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together and those who were with them,","34":"saying, “The Lord has really risen and has appeared to Simon!”","35":"They began to relate their experiences on the road, and how He was recognized by them at the breaking of the bread.","36":"Now while they were telling these things, Jesus Himself suddenly stood in their midst and *said to them, “Peace be to you.”","37":"But they were startled and frightened, and thought that they were looking at a spirit.","38":"And He said to them, “Why are you frightened, and why are doubts arising in your hearts?","39":"“See My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself;

And there was a royal official whose son was sick at Capernaum.","47":"When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea into Galilee, he went to Him and began asking Him to come down and heal his son; for he was at the point of death.","48":"Then Jesus said to him, “Unless you people see signs and wonders, you simply will not believe.”","49":"The royal official *said to Him, “Sir, come down before my child dies.”","50":"Jesus *said to him, “Go; your son is alive.” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went home.","51":"And as he was now going down, his slaves met him, saying that his son was alive.","52":"So he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better. Then they said to him, “Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.”","53":"So the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said to him, “Your son is alive”; and he himself believed, and his entire household.","54":"This is again a second sign that Jesus performed when He had come from Judea into Galilee."},"5":{"1":"After these things there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.","2":"Now in Jerusalem, by the Sheep Gate, there is a pool which in Hebrew is called Bethesda, having five porticoes.","3":"In these porticoes lay a multitude of those who were sick, blind, limping, or paralyzed.","4":"","5":"Now a man was there who had been ill for thirty-eight years.","6":"Jesus, upon seeing this man lying there and knowing that he had already been in that condition for a long time, *said to him, “Do you want to get well?”","7":"The sick man answered Him, “Sir, I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, but while I am coming, another steps down before me.”","8":"Jesus *said to him, “Get up, pick up your pallet and walk.”","9":"Immediately the man became well, and picked up his pallet and began to walk.\nNow it was a Sabbath on that day.","10":"So the Jews were saying to the man who was cured, “It is a Sabbath, and it is not permissible for you to carry your pallet.”","11":"But he answered them, “He who made me well was the one who said to me, ‘Pick up your pallet and walk.’”","12":"They asked him, “Who is the Man who said to you, ‘Pick it up and walk’?”","13":"But the man who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had slipped away while there was a crowd in that place.","14":"Afterward, Jesus *found him in the temple and said to him, “Behold, you have become well; do not sin anymore, so that nothing worse happens to you.”","15":"The man went away, and informed the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.","16":"For this reason the Jews were persecuting Jesus, because He was doing these things on a Sabbath.","17":"But He answered them, “My Father is working until now, and I Myself am working.”","18":"For this reason therefore the Jews were seeking all the more to kill Him, because He not only was breaking the Sabbath, but also was calling God His own Father, making Himself equal with God.","19":"Therefore Jesus answered and was saying to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of Himself, unless it is something He sees the Father doing; for whatever the Father does, these things the Son also does in the same way.","20":"“For the Father loves the Son and shows Him all things that He Himself is doing; and the Father will show Him greater works than these, so that you will be amazed.","21":"“For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so the Son also gives life to whom He wishes.","22":"“For not even the Father judges anyone, but He has given all judgment to the Son,","23":"so that all will honor the Son just as they honor the Father. The one who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him.","24":"“Truly, truly, I say to you, the one who hears My word, and believes Him who sent Me, has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.","25":"“Truly, truly, I say to you, a time is coming and even now has arrived, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.","26":"“For just as the Father has life in Himself, so He gave to the Son also to have life in Himself;","27":"and He gave Him authority to execute judgment, because He is the Son of Man.","28":"“Do not be amazed at this; for a time is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,","29":"and will come out: those who did the good deeds to a resurrection of life, those who committed the bad deeds to a resurrection of judgment.","30":"“I can do nothing on My own. As I hear, I judge; and My judgment is righteous, because I do not seek My own will but the will of Him who sent Me.","31":"“If I alone testify about Myself, My testimony is not true.","32":"“There is another who testifies about Me, and I know that the testimony which He gives about Me is true.","33":"“You have sent messengers to John, and he has testified to the truth.","34":"“But the testimony I receive is not from man, but I say these things so that you may be saved.","35":"“He was the lamp that was burning and shining, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light.","36":"“But the testimony I have is greater than the testimony of John; for the works which the Father has given Me to accomplish—the very works that I do—testify about Me, that the Father has sent Me.","37":"“And the Father who sent Me, He has testified about Me. You have neither heard His voice at any time, nor seen His form.","38":"“Also you do not have His word remaining in you, because you do not believe Him whom He sent.","39":"“You examine the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is those very Scriptures that testify about Me;","40":"and yet you are unwilling to come to Me so that you may have life.","41":"“I do not receive glory from people;","42":"but I know you, that you do not have the love of God in yourselves.","43":"“I have come in My Father’s name, and you do not receive Me; if another comes in his own name, you will receive him.","44":"“How can you believe, when you accept glory from one another and you do not seek the glory that is from the one and only God?","45":"“Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father; the one who accuses you is Moses, in whom you have put your hope.","46":"“For if you believed Moses, you would believe Me; for he wrote about Me.","47":"“But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe My words?”"},"6":{"1":"After these things Jesus went away to the other side of the Sea of Galilee (or Tiberias).","2":"A large crowd was following Him, because they were watching the signs which He was performing on those who were sick.","3":"But Jesus went up on the mountain, and there He sat with His disciples.","4":"Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.","5":"So Jesus, after raising His eyes and seeing that a large crowd was coming to Him, *said to Philip, “Where are we to buy bread so that these people may eat?”","6":"But He was saying this only to test him, for He Himself knew what He intended to do.","7":"Philip answered Him, “Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not enough for them, for each to receive just a little!”","8":"One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, *said to Him,","9":"“There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish; but what are these for so many people?”","10":"Jesus said, “Have the people recline to eat.” Now there was plenty of grass in the place. So the men reclined, about five thousand in number.","11":"Jesus then took the loaves, and after giving thanks He distributed them to those who were reclining; likewise also of the fish, as much as they wanted.","12":"And when they had eaten their fill, He *said to His disciples, “Gather up the leftover pieces so that nothing will be lost.”","13":"So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with pieces from the five barley loaves which were left over by those who had eaten.","14":"Therefore when the people saw the sign which He had performed, they said, “This is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world.”","15":"So Jesus, aware that they intended to come and take Him by force to make Him king, withdrew again to the mountain by Himself, alone.","16":"Now when evening came, His disciples went down to the sea,","17":"and after getting into a boat, they started to cross the sea to Capernaum. It had already become dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them.","18":"In addition, the sea began getting rough, because a strong wind was blowing.","19":"Then, when they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they *saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat; and they were frightened.","20":"But He *said to them, “It is I; do not be afraid.”","21":"So they were willing to take Him into the boat, and immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going.","22":"The next day the crowd that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other small boat there except one, and that Jesus had not gotten into the boat with His disciples, but that His disciples had departed alone.","23":"Other small boats came from Tiberias near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.","24":"So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor His disciples, they themselves got into the small boats and came to Capernaum, looking for Jesus.","25":"And when they found Him on the other side of the sea, they said to Him, “Rabbi, when did You get here?”","26":"Jesus answered them and said, “Truly, truly, I say to you, you seek Me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate some of the loaves and were filled.","27":"“Do not work for the food that perishes, but for the food that lasts for eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you, for on Him the Father, God, has set His seal.”","28":"Therefore they said to Him, “What are we to do, so that we may accomplish the works of God?”","29":"Jesus answered and said to them, “This is the work of God, that you believe in Him whom He has sent.”","30":"So they said to Him, “What then are You doing as a sign, so that we may see, and believe You? What work are You performing?","31":"“Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written: ‘HE GAVE THEM BREAD OUT OF HEAVEN TO EAT.’”","32":"Jesus then said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, it is not Moses who has given you the bread out of heaven, but it is My Father who gives you the true bread out of heaven.","33":"“For the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world.”","34":"Then they said to Him, “Lord, always give us this bread.”","35":"Jesus said to them, “I am the bread of life; the one who comes to Me will not be hungry, and the one who believes in Me will never be thirsty.","36":"“But I said to you that you have indeed seen Me, and yet you do not believe.","37":"“Everything that the Father gives Me will come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I certainly will not cast out.","38":"“For I have come down from heaven, not to do My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.","39":"“And this is the will of Him who sent Me, that of everything that He has given Me I will lose nothing, but will raise it up on the last day.","40":"“For this is the will of My Father, that everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him will have eternal life, and I Myself will raise him up on the last day.”","41":"So then the Jews were complaining about Him because He said, “I am the bread that came down out of heaven.”","42":"And they were saying, “Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does He now say, ‘I have come down out of heaven’?”","43":"Jesus answered and said to them, “Stop complaining among yourselves.","44":"“No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him; and I will raise him up on the last day.","45":"“It is written in the Prophets: ‘AND THEY SHALL ALL BE TAUGHT OF GOD.’ Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father, comes to Me.","46":"“Not that anyone has seen the Father, except the One who is from God; He has seen the Father.","47":"“Truly, truly, I say to you, the one who believes has eternal life.","48":"“I am the bread of life.","49":"“Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.","50":"“This is the bread that comes down out of heaven, so that anyone may eat from it and not die.","51":"“I am the living bread that came down out of heaven; if anyone eats from this bread, he will live forever; and the bread which I will give for the life of the world also is My flesh.”","52":"Then the Jews began to argue with one another, saying, “How can this Man give us His flesh to eat?”","53":"So Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in yourselves.","54":"“The one who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.","55":"“For My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink.","56":"“The one who eats My flesh and drinks My blood remains in Me, and I in him.","57":"“Just as the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, the one who eats Me, he also will live because of Me.","58":"“This is the bread that came down out of heaven, not as the fathers ate and died; the one who eats this bread will live forever.”","59":"These things He said in the synagogue as He taught in Capernaum.","60":"So then many of His disciples, when they heard this, said, “This statement is very unpleasant; who can listen to it?”","61":"But Jesus, aware that His disciples were complaining about this, said to them, “Is this offensive to you?","62":"“What then if you see the Son of Man ascending to where He was before?","63":"“It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh provides no benefit; the words that I have spoken to you are spirit, and are life.","64":"“But there are some of you who do not believe.” For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe, and who it was who would betray Him.","65":"And He was saying, “For this reason I have told you that no one can come to Me unless it has been granted him from the Father.”","66":"As a result of this many of His disciples left, and would no longer walk with Him.","67":"So Jesus said to the twelve, “You do not want to leave also, do you?”","68":"Simon Peter answered Him, “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have words of eternal life.","69":"“And we have already believed and have come to know that You are the Holy One of God.”","70":"Jesus answered them, “Did I Myself not choose you, the twelve? And yet one of you is a devil.”","71":"Now He meant Judas the son of Simon Iscariot; for he, one of the twelve, was going to betray Him."},"7":{"1":"After these things Jesus was walking in Galilee, for He was unwilling to walk in Judea because the Jews were seeking to kill Him.","2":"Now the feast of the Jews, the Feast of Booths, was near.","3":"So His brothers said to Him, “Move on from here and go into Judea, so that Your disciples also may see Your works which You are doing.","4":"“For no one does anything in secret when he himself is striving to be known publicly. If You are doing these things, show Yourself to the world.”","5":"For not even His brothers believed in Him.","6":"So Jesus *said to them, “My time is not yet here, but your time is always ready.","7":"“The world cannot hate you, but it hates Me because I testify about it, that its deeds are evil.","8":"“Go up to the feast yourselves; I am not going up to this feast, because My time has not yet fully arrived.”","9":"Now having said these things to them, He stayed in Galilee.","10":"But when His brothers had gone up to the feast, then He Himself also went up, not publicly, but as though in secret.","11":"So the Jews were looking for Him at the feast and saying, “Where is He?”","12":"And there was a great deal of talk about Him in secret among the crowds: some were saying, “He is a good man”; others were saying, “No, on the contrary, He is misleading the people.”","13":"However, no one was speaking openly about Him, for fear of the Jews.","14":"But when it was now the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple area, and began to teach.","15":"The Jews then were astonished, saying, “How has this Man become learned, not having been educated?”","16":"So Jesus answered them and said, “My teaching is not My own, but His who sent Me.","17":"“If anyone is willing to do His will, he will know about the teaching, whether it is of God, or I am speaking from Myself.","18":"“The one who speaks from himself seeks his own glory; but He who is seeking the glory of the One who sent Him, He is true, and there is no unrighteousness in Him.","19":"“Did Moses not give you the Law, and yet none of you carries out the Law? Why are you seeking to kill Me?”","20":"The crowd answered, “You have a demon! Who is seeking to kill You?”","21":"Jesus answered them, “I did one deed, and you all are astonished.","22":"“For this reason Moses has given you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and even on a Sabbath you circumcise a man.","23":"“If a man receives circumcision on a Sabbath so that the Law of Moses will not be broken, are you angry at Me because I made an entire man well on a Sabbath?","24":"“Do not judge by the outward appearance, but judge with righteous judgment.”","25":"So some of the people of Jerusalem were saying, “Is this Man not the one whom they are seeking to kill?","26":"“And yet look, He is speaking publicly, and they are saying nothing to Him. The rulers do not really know that this is the Christ, do they?","27":"“However, we know where this Man is from; but when the Christ comes, no one knows where He is from.”","28":"Then Jesus cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, “You both know Me and you know where I am from; and I have not come of Myself, but He who sent Me is true, whom you do not know.","29":"“I do know Him, because I am from Him, and He sent Me.”","30":"So they were seeking to arrest Him; and yet no one laid a hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come.","31":"But many of the crowd believed in Him; and they were saying, “When the Christ comes, He will not perform more signs than those which this man has done, will He?”","32":"The Pharisees heard the crowd whispering these things about Him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest Him.","33":"Therefore Jesus said, “For a little while longer I am going to be with you, and then I am going to Him who sent Me.","34":"“You will seek Me, and will not find Me; and where I am, you cannot come.”","35":"The Jews then said to one another, “Where does this Man intend to go that we will not find Him? He does not intend to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks, does He?","36":"“What is this statement that He said, ‘You will seek Me, and will not find Me; and where I am, you cannot come’?”","37":"Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink.","38":"“The one who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, ‘From his innermost being will flow rivers of living water.’”","39":"But this He said in reference to the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were to receive; for the Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.","40":"Some of the people therefore, after they heard these words, were saying, “This truly is the Prophet.”","41":"Others were saying, “This is the Christ.” But others were saying, “Surely the Christ is not coming from Galilee, is He?","42":"“Has the Scripture not said that the Christ comes from the descendants of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?”","43":"So a dissension occurred in the crowd because of Him.","44":"And some of them wanted to arrest Him, but no one laid hands on Him.","45":"The officers then came to the chief priests and Pharisees, and they said to them, “Why did you not bring Him?”","46":"The officers answered, “Never has a man spoken in this way!”","47":"The Pharisees then replied to them, “You have not been led astray too, have you?","48":"“Not one of the rulers or Pharisees has believed in Him, has he?","49":"“But this crowd that does not know the Law is accursed!”","50":"Nicodemus (the one who came to Him before, being one of them) *said to them,","51":"“Our Law does not judge the person unless it first hears from him and knows what he is doing, does it?”","52":"They answered and said to him, “You are not from Galilee as well, are you? Examine the Scriptures, and see that no prophet arises out of Galilee.”","53":"And everyone went to his home."},"8":{"1":"But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.","2":"And early in the morning He came again into the temple area, and all the people were coming to Him; and He sat down and began teaching them.","3":"Now the scribes and the Pharisees *brought a woman caught in the act of adultery, and after placing her in the center of the courtyard,","4":"they *said to Him, “Teacher, this woman has been caught in the very act of committing adultery.","5":"“Now in the Law, Moses commanded us to stone such women; what then do You say?”","6":"Now they were saying this to test Him, so that they might have grounds for accusing Him. But Jesus stooped down and with His finger wrote on the ground.","7":"When they persisted in asking Him, He straightened up and said to them, “He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her.”","8":"And again He stooped down and wrote on the ground.","9":"Now when they heard this, they began leaving, one by one, beginning with the older ones, and He was left alone, and the woman where she was, in the center of the courtyard.","10":"And straightening up, Jesus said to her, “Woman, where are they? Did no one condemn you?”","11":"She said, “No one, Lord.” And Jesus said, “I do not condemn you, either. Go. From now on do not sin any longer.”]]","12":"Then Jesus again spoke to them, saying, “I am the Light of the world; the one who follows Me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the Light of life.”","13":"So the Pharisees said to Him, “You are testifying about Yourself; Your testimony is not true.”","14":"Jesus answered and said to them, “Even if I am testifying about Myself, My testimony is true, because I know where I came from and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from or where I am going.","15":"“You judge according to the flesh; I am not judging anyone.","16":"“But even if I do judge, My judgment is true; for I am not alone in it, but I and the Father who sent Me.","17":"“Even in your Law it has been written that the testimony of two people is true.","18":"“I am He who testifies about Myself, and the Father who sent Me testifies about Me.”","19":"So they were saying to Him, “Where is Your Father?” Jesus answered, “You know neither Me nor My Father; if you knew Me, you would know My Father also.”","20":"These words He spoke in the treasury, as He taught in the temple area; and no one arrested Him, because His hour had not yet come.","21":"Then He said again to them, “I am going away, and you will look for Me, and will die in your sin; where I am going, you cannot come.”","22":"So the Jews were saying, “Surely He will not kill Himself, will He, since He says, ‘Where I am going, you cannot come’?”","23":"And He was saying to them, “You are from below, I am from above; you are of this world, I am not of this world.","24":"“Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins; for unless you believe that I am, you will die in your sins.”","25":"Then they were saying to Him, “Who are You?” Jesus said to them, “What have I even been saying to you from the beginning?","26":"“I have many things to say and to judge regarding you, but He who sent Me is true; and the things which I heard from Him, these I say to the world.”","27":"They did not realize that He was speaking to them about the Father.","28":"So Jesus said, “When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am, and I do nothing on My own, but I say these things as the Father instructed Me.","29":"“And He who sent Me is with Me; He has not left Me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to Him.”","30":"As He said these things, many came to believe in Him.","31":"So Jesus was saying to those Jews who had believed Him, “If you continue in My word, then you are truly My disciples;","32":"and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”","33":"They answered Him, “We are Abraham’s descendants and have never been enslaved to anyone; how is it that You say, ‘You will become free’?”","34":"Jesus answered them, “Truly, truly I say to you, everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin.","35":"“Now the slave does not remain in the house forever; the son does remain forever.","36":"“So if the Son sets you free, you really will be free.","37":"“I know that you are Abraham’s descendants; yet you are seeking to kill Me, because My word has no place in you.","38":"“I speak of the things which I have seen with My Father; therefore you also do the things which you heard from your father.”","39":"They answered and said to Him, “Abraham is our father.” Jesus *said to them, “If you are Abraham’s children, do the deeds of Abraham.","40":"“But as it is, you are seeking to kill Me, a Man who has told you the truth, which I heard from God; this Abraham did not do.","41":"“You are doing the deeds of your father.” They said to Him, “We were not born as a result of sexual immorality; we have one Father: God.”","42":"Jesus said to them, “If God were your Father, you would love Me, for I came forth from God and am here; for I have not even come on My own, but He sent Me.","43":"“Why do you not understand what I am saying? It is because you cannot listen to My word.","44":"“You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father.

Then how does he now see?”","20":"His parents then answered and said, “We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;","21":"but how he now sees, we do not know; or who opened his eyes, we do not know. Ask him; he is of age, he will speak for himself.”","22":"His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews; for the Jews had already reached the decision that if anyone confessed Him to be Christ, he was to be excommunicated from the synagogue.","23":"It was for this reason that his parents said, “He is of age; ask him.”","24":"So for a second time they summoned the man who had been blind, and said to him, “Give glory to God; we know that this Man is a sinner.”","25":"He then answered, “Whether He is a sinner, I do not know; one thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see.”","26":"So they said to him, “What did He do to you? How did He open your eyes?”","27":"He answered them, “I told you already and you did not listen; why do you want to hear it again? You do not want to become His disciples too, do you?”","28":"They spoke abusively to him and said, “You are His disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.","29":"“We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this Man, we do not know where He is from.”","30":"The man answered and said to them, “Well, here is the amazing thing, that you do not know where He is from, and yet He opened my eyes!","31":"“We know that God does not listen to sinners; but if someone is God-fearing and does His will, He listens to him.","32":"“Since the beginning of time it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a person born blind.","33":"“If this Man were not from God, He could do nothing.”","34":"They answered him, “You were born entirely in sins, and yet you are teaching us?” So they put him out.","35":"Jesus heard that they had put him out, and upon finding him, He said, “Do you believe in the Son of Man?”","36":"He answered by saying, “And who is He, Sir, that I may believe in Him?”","37":"Jesus said to him, “You have both seen Him, and He is the One who is talking with you.”","38":"And he said, “I believe, Lord.” And he worshiped Him.","39":"And Jesus said, “For judgment I came into this world, so that those who do not see may see, and those who see may become blind.”","40":"Those who were with Him from the Pharisees heard these things and said to Him, “We are not blind too, are we?”","41":"Jesus said to them, “If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now that you maintain, ‘We see,’ your sin remains."},"10":{"1":"“Truly, truly I say to you, the one who does not enter by the door into the fold of the sheep, but climbs up some other way, he is a thief and a robber.","2":"“But the one who enters by the door is a shepherd of the sheep.","3":"“To him the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep listen to his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.","4":"“When he puts all his own sheep outside, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice.","5":"“However, a stranger they simply will not follow, but will flee from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers.”","6":"Jesus told them this figure of speech, but they did not understand what the things which He was saying to them meant.","7":"So Jesus said to them again, “Truly, truly I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.","8":"“All those who came before Me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.","9":"“I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture.","10":"“The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I came so that they would have life, and have it abundantly.","11":"“I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.","12":"“He who is a hired hand, and not a shepherd, who is not the owner of the sheep, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf snatches them and scatters the flock.","13":"“He flees because he is a hired hand and does not care about the sheep.","14":"“I am the good shepherd, and I know My own, and My own know Me,","15":"just as the Father knows Me and I know the Father; and I lay down My life for the sheep.","16":"“And I have other sheep that are not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they will listen to My voice; and they will become one flock, with one shepherd.","17":"“For this reason the Father loves Me, because I lay down My life so that I may take it back.","18":"“No one has taken it away from Me, but I lay it down on My own. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it back. This commandment I received from My Father.”","19":"Dissension occurred again among the Jews because of these words.","20":"Many of them were saying, “He has a demon and is insane. Why do you listen to Him?”","21":"Others were saying, “These are not the words of one who is demon-possessed. A demon cannot open the eyes of those who are blind, can it?”","22":"At that time the Feast of the Dedication took place in Jerusalem;","23":"it was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple area, in the portico of Solomon.","24":"The Jews then surrounded Him and began saying to Him, “How long will You keep us in suspense? If You are the Christ, tell us plainly.”","25":"Jesus answered them, “I told you, and you do not believe; the works that I do in My Father’s name, these testify of Me.","26":"“But you do not believe, because you are not of My sheep.","27":"“My sheep listen to My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me;","28":"and I give them eternal life, and they will never perish; and no one will snatch them out of My hand.","29":"“My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand.","30":"“I and the Father are one.”","31":"The Jews picked up stones again to stone Him.","32":"Jesus replied to them, “I showed you many good works from the Father; for which of them are you stoning Me?”","33":"The Jews answered Him, “We are not stoning You for a good work, but for blasphemy; and because You, being a man, make Yourself out to be God.”","34":"Jesus answered them, “Has it not been written in your Law: ‘I SAID, YOU ARE GODS’?","35":"“If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture cannot be nullified),","36":"are you saying of Him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, ‘You are blaspheming,’ because I said, ‘I am the Son of God’?","37":"“If I do not do the works of My Father, do not believe Me;","38":"but if I do them, even though you do not believe Me, believe the works, so that you may know and understand that the Father is in Me, and I in the Father.”","39":"Therefore they were seeking again to arrest Him, and He eluded their grasp.","40":"And He went away again beyond the Jordan to the place where John was first baptizing, and He stayed there.","41":"Many came to Him and were saying, “While John performed no sign, yet everything John said about this Man was true.”","42":"And many believed in Him there."},"11":{"1":"Now a certain man was sick: Lazarus of Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.","2":"And it was the Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.","3":"So the sisters sent word to Him, saying, “Lord, behold, he whom You love is sick.”","4":"But when Jesus heard this, He said, “This sickness is not meant for death, but is for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified by it.”","5":"(Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister, and Lazarus.)","6":"So when He heard that he was sick, He then stayed two days longer in the place where He was.","7":"Then after this He *said to the disciples, “Let’s go to Judea again.”","8":"The disciples *said to Him, “Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone You, and yet You are going there again?”","9":"Jesus replied, “Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks during the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.","10":"“But if anyone walks during the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.”","11":"This He said, and after this He *said to them, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going so that I may awaken him from sleep.”","12":"The disciples then said to Him, “Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will come out of it.”","13":"Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that He was speaking about actual sleep.","14":"So Jesus then said to them plainly, “Lazarus died,","15":"and I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may believe; but let’s go to him.”","16":"Therefore Thomas, who was called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, “Let’s also go, so that we may die with Him!”","17":"So when Jesus came, He found that he had already been in the tomb four days.","18":"Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia away;","19":"and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, to console them about their brother.","20":"So then Martha, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went to meet Him, but Mary stayed in the house.","21":"Martha then said to Jesus, “Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.","22":"“Even now I know that whatever You ask of God, God will give You.”","23":"Jesus *said to her, “Your brother will rise from the dead.”","24":"Martha *said to Him, “I know that he will rise in the resurrection on the last day.”","25":"Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life; the one who believes in Me will live, even if he dies,","26":"and everyone who lives and believes in Me will never die. Do you believe this?”","27":"She *said to Him, “Yes, Lord; I have come to believe that You are the Christ, the Son of God, and He who comes into the world.”","28":"When she had said this, she left and called Mary her sister, saying secretly, “The Teacher is here and is calling for you.”","29":"And when she heard this, she *got up quickly and came to Him.","30":"Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was still at the place where Martha met Him.","31":"Then the Jews who were with her in the house and were consoling her, when they saw that Mary had gotten up quickly and left, they followed her, thinking that she was going to the tomb to weep there.","32":"So when Mary came to the place where Jesus was, she saw Him and fell at His feet, saying to Him, “Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.”","33":"Therefore when Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her also weeping, He was deeply moved in spirit and was troubled,","34":"and He said, “Where have you laid him?” They *said to Him, “Lord, come and see.”","35":"Jesus wept.","36":"So the Jews were saying, “See how He loved him!”","37":"But some of them said, “Could this Man, who opened the eyes of the man who was blind, not have also kept this man from dying?”","38":"So Jesus, again being deeply moved within, *came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone was lying against it.","39":"Jesus *said, “Remove the stone.” Martha, the sister of the deceased, *said to Him, “Lord, by this time there will be a stench, for he has been dead four days.”","40":"Jesus *said to her, “Did I not say to you that if you believe, you will see the glory of God?”","41":"So they removed the stone. And Jesus raised His eyes, and said, “Father, I thank You that You have heard Me.","42":"“But I knew that You always hear Me; nevertheless, because of the people standing around I said it, so that they may believe that You sent Me.”","43":"And when He had said these things, He cried out with a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out!”","44":"Out came the man who had died, bound hand and foot with wrappings, and his face was wrapped around with a cloth. Jesus *said to them, “Unbind him, and let him go.”","45":"Therefore many of the Jews who came to Mary, and saw what He had done, believed in Him.","46":"But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them the things which Jesus had done.","47":"Therefore the chief priests and the Pharisees convened a council meeting, and they were saying, “What are we doing in regard to the fact that this Man is performing many signs?","48":"“If we let Him go on like this, all the people will believe in Him, and the Romans will come and take over both our place and our nation.”","49":"But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, “You know nothing at all,","50":"nor are you taking into account that it is in your best interest that one man die for the people, and that the whole nation not perish instead.”","51":"Now he did not say this on his own, but as he was high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation;","52":"and not for the nation only, but in order that He might also gather together into one the children of God who are scattered abroad.","53":"So from that day on they planned together to kill Him.","54":"Therefore Jesus no longer continued to walk publicly among the Jews, but went away from there to the region near the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim; and there He stayed with the disciples.","55":"Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went up to Jerusalem from the country prior to the Passover, in order to purify themselves.","56":"So they were looking for Jesus, and saying to one another as they stood in the temple area, “What do you think; that He will not come to the feast at all?”","57":"Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where He was, he was to report it, so that they might arrest Him."},"12":{"1":"Therefore, six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.","2":"So they made Him a dinner there, and Martha was serving; and Lazarus was one of those reclining at the table with Him.","3":"Mary then took a pound of very expensive perfume of pure nard, and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped His feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.","4":"But Judas Iscariot, one of His disciples, the one who intended to betray Him, *said,","5":"“Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and the proceeds given to poor people?”","6":"Now he said this, not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief, and as he kept the money box, he used to steal from what was put into it.","7":"Therefore Jesus said, “Leave her alone, so that she may keep it for the day of My burial.","8":"“For you always have the poor with you, but you do not always have Me.”","9":"The large crowd of the Jews then learned that He was there; and they came, not on account of Jesus only, but so that they might also see Lazarus, whom He raised from the dead.","10":"But the chief priests planned to put Lazarus to death also,","11":"because on account of him many of the Jews were going away and were believing in Jesus.","12":"On the next day, when the large crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,","13":"they took the branches of the palm trees and went out to meet Him, and began shouting, “Hosanna! BLESSED IS HE WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD, indeed, the King of Israel!”","14":"Jesus, finding a young donkey, sat on it; as it is written:","15":"“DO NOT FEAR, DAUGHTER OF ZION; BEHOLD, YOUR KING IS COMING, SEATED ON A DONKEY’S COLT.”","16":"These things His disciples did not understand at the first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of Him, and that they had done these things for Him.","17":"So the people, who were with Him when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead, continued to testify about Him.","18":"For this reason also the people went to meet Him, because they heard that He had performed this sign.","19":"So the Pharisees said to one another, “You see that you are not accomplishing anything; look, the world has gone after Him!”","20":"Now there were some Greeks among those who were going up to worship at the feast;","21":"these people then came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and were making a request of him, saying, “Sir, we wish to see Jesus.”","22":"Philip *came and *told Andrew; then Andrew and Philip *came and *told Jesus.","23":"But Jesus *answered them by saying, “The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.","24":"“Truly, truly I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.","25":"“The one who loves his life loses it, and the one who hates his life in this world will keep it to eternal life.","26":"“If anyone serves Me, he must follow Me; and where I am, there My servant will be also; if anyone serves Me, the Father will honor him.","27":"“Now My soul has become troubled; and what am I to say? ‘Father, save Me from this hour’? But for this purpose I came to this hour.","28":"“Father, glorify Your name.” Then a voice came out of heaven: “I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.”","29":"So the crowd who stood by and heard it were saying that it had thundered; others were saying, “An angel has spoken to Him!”","30":"Jesus responded and said, “This voice has not come for My sake, but for yours.","31":"“Now judgment is upon this world; now the ruler of this world will be cast out.","32":"“And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to Myself.”","33":"Now He was saying this to indicate what kind of death He was going to die.","34":"The crowd then answered Him, “We have heard from the Law that the Christ is to remain forever; and how is it that You say, ‘The Son of Man must be lifted up’? Who is this Son of Man?”","35":"So Jesus said to them, “For a little while longer the Light is among you. Walk while you have the Light, so that darkness will not overtake you; also, the one who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.","36":"“While you have the Light, believe in the Light, so that you may become sons of Light.”\nThese things Jesus proclaimed, and He went away and hid Himself from them.","37":"But though He had performed so many signs in their sight, they still were not believing in Him.","38":"This happened so that the word of Isaiah the prophet which he spoke would be fulfilled: “LORD, WHO HAS BELIEVED OUR REPORT? AND TO WHOM HAS THE ARM OF THE LORD BEEN REVEALED?”","39":"For this reason they could not believe, for Isaiah said again,","40":"“HE HAS BLINDED THEIR EYES AND HE HARDENED THEIR HEART, SO THAT THEY WILL NOT SEE WITH THEIR EYES AND UNDERSTAND WITH THEIR HEART, AND BE CONVERTED, AND SO I WILL NOT HEAL THEM.”","41":"These things Isaiah said because he saw His glory, and he spoke about Him.","42":"Nevertheless many, even of the rulers, believed in Him, but because of the Pharisees they were not confessing Him, so that they would not be excommunicated from the synagogue;","43":"for they loved the approval of people rather than the approval of God.","44":"Now Jesus cried out and said, “The one who believes in Me, does not believe only in Me, but also in Him who sent Me.","45":"“And the one who sees Me sees Him who sent Me.","46":"“I have come as Light into the world, so that no one who believes in Me will remain in darkness.","47":"“If anyone hears My teachings and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world.","48":"“The one who rejects Me and does not accept My teachings has one who judges him: the word which I spoke. That will judge him on the last day.","49":"“For I did not speak on My own, but the Father Himself who sent Me has given Me a commandment as to what to say and what to speak.","50":"“And I know that His commandment is eternal life; therefore the things I speak, I speak just as the Father has told Me.”"},"13":{"1":"Now before the Feast of the Passover, Jesus, knowing that His hour had come that He would depart from this world to the Father, having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the end.","2":"And during supper, the devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, to betray Him,","3":"Jesus, knowing that the Father had handed all things over to Him, and that He had come forth from God and was going back to God,","4":"*got up from supper and *laid His outer garments aside; and He took a towel and tied it around Himself.","5":"Then He *poured water into the basin, and began washing the disciples’ feet and wiping them with the towel which He had tied around Himself.","6":"So He *came to Simon Peter. He *said to Him, “Lord, You are washing my feet?”","7":"Jesus answered and said to him, “What I am doing, you do not realize right now, but you will understand later.”","8":"Peter *said to Him, “Never shall You wash my feet!” Jesus answered him, “If I do not wash you, you have no place with Me.”","9":"Simon Peter *said to Him, “Lord, then wash not only my feet, but also my hands and my head!”","10":"Jesus *said to him, “He who has bathed needs only to wash his feet; otherwise he is completely clean. And you are clean—but not all of you.”","11":"For He knew the one who was betraying Him; it was for this reason that He said, “Not all of you are clean.”","12":"Then, when He had washed their feet, and taken His garments and reclined at the table again, He said to them, “Do you know what I have done for you?","13":"“You call Me ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord’; and you are correct, for so I am.","14":"“So if I, the Lord and the Teacher, washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet.","15":"“For I gave you an example, so that you also would do just as I did for you.","16":"“Truly, truly I say to you, a slave is not greater than his master, nor is one who is sent greater than the one who sent him.","17":"“If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them.","18":"“I am not speaking about all of you. I know the ones whom I have chosen; but this is happening so that the Scripture may be fulfilled, ‘HE WHO EATS MY BREAD HAS LIFTED UP HIS HEEL AGAINST ME.’","19":"“From now on I am telling you before it happens, so that when it does happen, you may believe that I am He.","20":"“Truly, truly I say to you, the one who receives anyone I send, receives Me; and the one who receives Me receives Him who sent Me.”","21":"When Jesus had said these things, He became troubled in spirit, and testified and said, “Truly, truly I say to you that one of you will betray Me.”","22":"The disciples began looking at one another, at a loss to know of which one He was speaking.","23":"Lying back on Jesus’ chest was one of His disciples, whom Jesus loved.","24":"So Simon Peter *nodded to this disciple and *said to him, “Tell us who it is of whom He is speaking.”","25":"He then simply leaned back on Jesus’ chest and *said to Him, “Lord, who is it?”","26":"Jesus then *answered, “That man is the one for whom I shall dip the piece of bread and give it to him.” So when He had dipped the piece of bread, He *took and *gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.","27":"After this, Satan then entered him. Therefore Jesus *said to him, “What you are doing, do it quickly.”","28":"Now none of those reclining at the table knew for what purpose He had said this to him.","29":"For some were assuming, since Judas kept the money box, that Jesus was saying to him, “Buy the things we need for the feast”; or else, that he was to give something to the poor.","30":"So after receiving the piece of bread, he left immediately; and it was night.","31":"Therefore when he had left, Jesus *said, “Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in Him;","32":"if God is glorified in Him, God will also glorify Him in Himself, and will glorify Him immediately.","33":"“Little children, I am still with you a little longer. You will look for Me; and just as I said to the Jews, now I also say to you: ‘Where I am going, you cannot come.’","34":"“I am giving you a new commandment, that you love one another; just as I have loved you, that you also love one another.","35":"“By this all people will know that you are My disciples: if you have love for one another.”","36":"Simon Peter *said to Him, “Lord, where are You going?” Jesus answered, “Where I am going, you cannot follow Me now; but you will follow later.”","37":"Peter *said to Him, “Lord, why can I not follow You right now?

Do You not know that I have authority to release You, and I have authority to crucify You?”","11":"Jesus answered him, “You would have no authority over Me at all, if it had not been given to you from above; for this reason the one who handed Me over to you has the greater sin.”","12":"As a result of this, Pilate made efforts to release Him; but the Jews shouted, saying, “If you release this Man, you are not a friend of Caesar; everyone who makes himself out to be a king opposes Caesar!”","13":"Therefore when Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called The Pavement—but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.","14":"Now it was the day of preparation for the Passover; it was about the sixth hour.

It was written: “JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS.”","20":"Therefore many of the Jews read this inscription, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, Latin, and in Greek.","21":"So the chief priests of the Jews were saying to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The King of the Jews’; rather, write that He said, ‘I am King of the Jews.’”","22":"Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.”","23":"Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took His outer garments and made four parts: a part to each soldier, and the tunic also; but the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece.","24":"So they said to one another, “Let’s not tear it, but cast lots for it, to decide whose it shall be.” This happened so that the Scripture would be fulfilled: “THEY DIVIDED MY GARMENTS AMONG THEMSELVES, AND THEY CAST LOTS FOR MY CLOTHING.” Therefore the soldiers did these things.","25":"Now beside the cross of Jesus stood His mother, His mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.","26":"So when Jesus saw His mother, and the disciple whom He loved standing nearby, He *said to His mother, “Woman, behold, your son!”","27":"Then He *said to the disciple, “Behold, your mother!” And from that hour the disciple took her into his own household.","28":"After this, Jesus, knowing that all things had already been accomplished, in order that the Scripture would be fulfilled, *said, “I am thirsty.”","29":"A jar full of sour wine was standing there; so they put a sponge full of the sour wine on a branch of hyssop and brought it up to His mouth.","30":"Therefore when Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, “It is finished!” And He bowed His head and gave up His spirit.","31":"Now then, since it was the day of preparation, to prevent the bodies from remaining on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), the Jews requested of Pilate that their legs be broken, and the bodies be taken away.","32":"So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man, and of the other who was crucified with Him;","33":"but after they came to Jesus, when they saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs.","34":"Yet one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.","35":"And he who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true; and he knows that he is telling the truth, so that you also may believe.","36":"For these things took place so that the Scripture would be fulfilled: “NOT A BONE OF HIM SHALL BE BROKEN.”","37":"And again another Scripture says, “THEY WILL LOOK AT HIM WHOM THEY PIERCED.”","38":"Now after these things Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but a secret one for fear of the Jews, requested of Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate granted permission. So he came and took away His body.","39":"Nicodemus, who had first come to Him by night, also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred litras weight.","40":"So they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen wrappings with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews.","41":"Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden was a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid.","42":"Therefore because of the Jewish day of preparation, since the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there."},"20":{"1":"Now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene *came early to the tomb, while it was still dark, and *saw the stone already removed from the tomb.","2":"So she *ran and *came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and *said to them, “They have taken the Lord from the tomb, and we do not know where they have put Him.”","3":"So Peter and the other disciple left, and they were going to the tomb.","4":"The two were running together; and the other disciple ran ahead, faster than Peter, and came to the tomb first;","5":"and he stooped to look in, and *saw the linen wrappings lying there; however he did not go in.","6":"So Simon Peter also *came, following him, and he entered the tomb; and he *looked at the linen wrappings lying there,","7":"and the face-cloth which had been on His head, not lying with the linen wrappings but folded up in a place by itself.","8":"So the other disciple who had first come to the tomb also entered then, and he saw and believed.","9":"For they did not yet understand the Scripture, that He must rise from the dead.","10":"So the disciples went away again to their own homes.","11":"But Mary was standing outside the tomb, weeping; so as she wept, she stooped to look into the tomb;","12":"and she *saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had been lying.","13":"And they *said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping?” She *said to them, “Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they put Him.”","14":"When she had said this, she turned around and *saw Jesus standing there, and yet she did not know that it was Jesus.","15":"Jesus *said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?” Thinking that He was the gardener, she *said to Him, “Sir, if you have carried Him away, tell me where you put Him, and I will take Him away.”","16":"Jesus *said to her, “Mary!” She turned and *said to Him in Hebrew, “Rabboni!” (which means, Teacher).","17":"Jesus *said to her, “Stop clinging to Me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to My brothers and say to them, ‘I am ascending to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God.’”","18":"Mary Magdalene *came and announced to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord,” and that He had said these things to her.","19":"Now when it was evening on that day, the first day of the week, and when the doors were shut where the disciples were together due to fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in their midst, and *said to them, “Peace be to you.”","20":"And when He had said this, He showed them both His hands and His side. The disciples then rejoiced when they saw the Lord.","21":"So Jesus said to them again, “Peace be to you; just as the Father has sent Me, I also send you.”","22":"And when He had said this, He breathed on them and *said to them, “Receive the Holy Spirit.","23":"“If you forgive the sins of any, their sins have been forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they have been retained.”","24":"But Thomas, one of the twelve, who was called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.","25":"So the other disciples were saying to him, “We have seen the Lord!” But he said to them, “Unless I see in His hands the imprint of the nails, and put my finger into the place of the nails, and put my hand into His side, I will not believe.”","26":"Eight days later His disciples were again inside, and Thomas was with them. Jesus *came, the doors having been shut, and stood in their midst and said, “Peace be to you.”","27":"Then He *said to Thomas, “Place your finger here, and see My hands; and take your hand and put it into My side; and do not continue in disbelief, but be a believer.”","28":"Thomas answered and said to Him, “My Lord and my God!”","29":"Jesus *said to him, “Because you have seen Me, have you now believed? Blessed are they who did not see, and yet believed.”","30":"So then, many other signs Jesus also performed in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book;","31":"but these have been written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that by believing you may have life in His name."},"21":{"1":"After these things Jesus revealed Himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias, and He revealed Himself in this way:","2":"Simon Peter, Thomas who was called Didymus, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of His disciples were together.","3":"Simon Peter *said to them, “I am going fishing.” They *said to him, “We are also coming with you.” They went out and got into the boat; and that night they caught nothing.","4":"But when the day was now breaking, Jesus stood on the beach; yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.","5":"So Jesus *said to them, “Children, you do not have any fish to eat, do you?” They answered Him, “No.”","6":"And He said to them, “Cast the net on the right-hand side of the boat, and you will find the fish.” So they cast it, and then they were not able to haul it in because of the great quantity of fish.","7":"Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved *said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his outer garment (for he was stripped for work), and threw himself into the sea.","8":"But the other disciples came in the little boat, for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits away, dragging the net full of fish.","9":"So when they got out on the land, they *saw a charcoal fire already made and fish placed on it, and bread.","10":"Jesus *said to them, “Bring some of the fish which you have now caught.”","11":"So Simon Peter went up and hauled the net to land, full of large fish, 153; and although there were so many, the net was not torn.","12":"Jesus *said to them, “Come and have breakfast.” None of the disciples ventured to inquire of Him, “Who are You?” knowing that it was the Lord.","13":"Jesus *came and *took the bread and *gave it to them, and the fish likewise.","14":"This was now the third time that Jesus revealed Himself to the disciples, after He was raised from the dead.","15":"Now when they had finished breakfast, Jesus *said to Simon Peter, “Simon, son of John, do you love Me more than these?” He *said to Him, “Yes, Lord; You know that I love You.” He *said to him, “Tend My lambs.”","16":"He *said to him again, a second time, “Simon, son of John, do you love Me?” He *said to Him, “Yes, Lord; You know that I love You.” He *said to him, “Shepherd My sheep.”","17":"He *said to him the third time, “Simon, son of John, do you love Me?” Peter was hurt because He said to him the third time, “Do you love Me?” And he said to Him, “Lord, You know all things; You know that I love You.” Jesus *said to him, “Tend My sheep.","18":"“Truly, truly I tell you, when you were younger, you used to put on your belt and walk wherever you wanted; but when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands and someone else will put your belt on you, and bring you where you do not want to go.”","19":"Now He said this, indicating by what kind of death he would glorify God.

You follow Me!”","23":"Therefore this account went out among the brothers, that that disciple would not die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but only, “If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you?”","24":"This is the disciple who is testifying about these things and wrote these things, and we know that his testimony is true.","25":"But there are also many other things which Jesus did, which, if they were written in detail, I expect that even the world itself would not contain the books that would be written."}},"Acts":{"1":{"1":"The first account I composed, Theophilus, about all that Jesus began to do and teach,","2":"until the day when He was taken up to heaven, after He had given orders by the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom He had chosen.","3":"To these He also presented Himself alive after His suffering, by many convincing proofs, appearing to them over a period of forty days and speaking of things regarding the kingdom of God.","4":"Gathering them together, He commanded them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait for what the Father had promised, “Which,” He said, “you heard of from Me;","5":"for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now.”","6":"So, when they had come together, they began asking Him, saying, “Lord, is it at this time that You are restoring the kingdom to Israel?”","7":"But He said to them, “It is not for you to know periods of time or appointed times which the Father has set by His own authority;","8":"but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and Samaria, and as far as the remotest part of the earth.”","9":"And after He had said these things, He was lifted up while they were watching, and a cloud took Him up, out of their sight.","10":"And as they were gazing intently into the sky while He was going, then behold, two men in white clothing stood beside them,","11":"and they said, “Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into the sky? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you have watched Him go into heaven.”","12":"Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day’s journey away.","13":"When they had entered the city, they went up to the upstairs room where they were staying, that is, Peter, John, James, and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James.","14":"All these were continually devoting themselves with one mind to prayer, along with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His brothers.","15":"At this time Peter stood up among the brothers and sisters (a group of about 120 people was there together), and said,","16":"“Brothers, the Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit foretold by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus.","17":"“For he was counted among us and received his share in this ministry.”","18":"(Now this man acquired a field with the price of his wickedness, and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his intestines gushed out.","19":"And it became known to all the residents of Jerusalem;

Now Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends.","25":"When Peter entered, Cornelius met him, and fell at his feet and worshiped him.","26":"But Peter helped him up, saying, “Stand up; I, too, am just a man.”","27":"As he talked with him, he entered and *found many people assembled.","28":"And he said to them, “You yourselves know that it is forbidden for a Jewish man to associate with or visit a foreigner; and yet God has shown me that I am not to call any person unholy or unclean.","29":"“That is why I came without even raising any objection when I was sent for. So I ask, for what reason did you send for me?”","30":"Cornelius said, “Four days ago to this hour, I was praying in my house during the ninth hour; and behold, a man stood before me in shining clothing,","31":"and he *said, ‘Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your charitable gifts have been remembered before God.","32":"‘Therefore send some men to Joppa and invite Simon, who is also called Peter, to come to you; he is staying at the house of Simon the tanner, by the sea.’","33":"“So I sent men to you immediately, and you have been kind enough to come.

And he said, “Report these things to James and the brothers.” Then he left and went to another place.","18":"Now when day came, there was no small disturbance among the soldiers as to what could have become of Peter.","19":"When Herod had searched for him and had not found him, he examined the guards and ordered that they be led away to execution. Then he went down from Judea to Caesarea and was spending time there.","20":"Now he was very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon; and with one mind they came to him, and having won over Blastus the king’s chamberlain, they were asking for peace, because their country was supported with grain from the king’s country.","21":"On an appointed day, after putting on his royal apparel, Herod took his seat on the rostrum and began delivering an address to them.","22":"The people repeatedly cried out, “The voice of a god and not of a man!”","23":"And immediately an angel of the Lord struck him because he did not give God the glory, and he was eaten by worms and died.","24":"But the word of the Lord continued to grow and to be multiplied.","25":"And Barnabas and Saul returned when they had fulfilled their mission to Jerusalem, taking along with them John, who was also called Mark."},"13":{"1":"Now there were prophets and teachers at Antioch, in the church that was there: Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.","2":"While they were serving the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, “Set Barnabas and Saul apart for Me for the work to which I have called them.”","3":"Then, when they had fasted, prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.","4":"So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia and from there they sailed to Cyprus.","5":"When they reached Salamis, they began to proclaim the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews; and they also had John as their helper.","6":"When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, they found a magician, a Jewish false prophet whose name was Bar-Jesus,","7":"who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of intelligence. This man summoned Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God.","8":"But Elymas the magician (for so his name is translated) was opposing them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith.","9":"But Saul, who was also known as Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, stared at him,","10":"and said, “You who are full of all deceit and fraud, you son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not stop making crooked the straight ways of the Lord?","11":"“Now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you will be blind and not see the sun for a time.” And immediately a mist and a darkness fell upon him, and he went about seeking those who would lead him by the hand.","12":"Then the proconsul believed when he saw what had happened, being amazed at the teaching of the Lord.","13":"Now Paul and his companions put out to sea from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia; but John left them and returned to Jerusalem.","14":"But going on from Perga, they arrived at Pisidian Antioch, and on the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down.","15":"After the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the synagogue officials sent word to them, saying, “Brothers, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, say it.”","16":"Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand said,\n“Men of Israel, and you who fear God, listen:","17":"“The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm He led them out from it.","18":"“For a period of about forty years He put up with them in the wilderness.","19":"“When He had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, He distributed their land as an inheritance—all of which took about 450 years.","20":"“After these things He gave them judges until Samuel the prophet.","21":"“Then they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.","22":"“After He had removed him, He raised up David to be their king, concerning whom He also testified and said, ‘I have found David, the son of Jesse, a man after My heart, who will do all My will.’","23":"“From the descendants of this man, according to promise, God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus,","24":"after John had proclaimed, before His coming, a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.","25":"“And while John was completing his course, he kept saying, ‘What do you suppose that I am? I am not He. But behold, One is coming after me, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.’","26":"“Brothers, sons of Abraham’s family, and those among you who fear God, to us the message of this salvation has been sent.","27":"“For those who live in Jerusalem, and their rulers, recognizing neither Him nor the declarations of the prophets which are read every Sabbath, fulfilled these by condemning Him.","28":"“And though they found no grounds for putting Him to death, they asked Pilate that He be executed.","29":"“When they had carried out everything that was written concerning Him, they took Him down from the cross and laid Him in a tomb.","30":"“But God raised Him from the dead;","31":"and for many days He appeared to those who came up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem, the very ones who are now His witnesses to the people.","32":"“And we preach to you the good news of the promise made to the fathers,","33":"that God has fulfilled this promise to those of us who are the descendants by raising Jesus, as it is also written in the second Psalm: ‘YOU ARE MY SON; TODAY I HAVE FATHERED YOU.’","34":"“As for the fact that He raised Him from the dead, never again to return to decay, He has spoken in this way: ‘I WILL GIVE YOU THE HOLY AND FAITHFUL MERCIES OF DAVID.’","35":"“Therefore, He also says in another Psalm: ‘YOU WILL NOT ALLOW YOUR HOLY ONE TO UNDERGO DECAY.’","36":"“For David, after he had served God’s purpose in his own generation, fell asleep, and was buried among his fathers and underwent decay;","37":"but He whom God raised did not undergo decay.","38":"“Therefore let it be known to you, brothers, that through Him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you,","39":"and through Him everyone who believes is freed from all things, from which you could not be freed through the Law of Moses.","40":"“Therefore, see that the thing spoken of in the Prophets does not come upon you:","41":"‘LOOK, YOU SCOFFERS, AND BE ASTONISHED, AND PERISH;\nFOR I AM ACCOMPLISHING A WORK IN YOUR DAYS,\nA WORK WHICH YOU WILL NEVER BELIEVE, THOUGH SOMEONE SHOULD DESCRIBE IT TO YOU.’”","42":"As Paul and Barnabas were going out, the people repeatedly begged to have these things spoken to them the next Sabbath.","43":"Now when the meeting of the synagogue had broken up, many of the Jews and the God-fearing proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who were speaking to them and urging them to continue in the grace of God.","44":"The next Sabbath nearly all the city assembled to hear the word of the Lord.","45":"But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and began contradicting the things spoken by Paul, and were blaspheming.","46":"Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly and said, “It was necessary that the word of God be spoken to you first. Since you repudiate it and consider yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we are turning to the Gentiles.","47":"“For so the Lord has commanded us,\n‘I HAVE APPOINTED YOU AS A LIGHT TO THE GENTILES,\nTHAT YOU MAY BRING SALVATION TO THE END OF THE EARTH.’”","48":"When the Gentiles heard this, they began rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord; and all who had been appointed to eternal life believed.","49":"And the word of the Lord was being spread through the whole region.","50":"But the Jews incited the devout women of prominence and the leading men of the city, and instigated a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their region.","51":"But they shook off the dust from their feet in protest against them and went to Iconium.","52":"And the disciples were continually filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit."},"14":{"1":"In Iconium they entered the synagogue of the Jews together, and spoke in such a way that a large number of people believed, both of Jews and of Greeks.","2":"But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the minds of the Gentiles and embittered them against the brothers.","3":"Therefore they spent a long time there speaking boldly with reliance upon the Lord, who was testifying to the word of His grace, granting that signs and wonders be performed by their hands.","4":"But the people of the city were divided; and some sided with the Jews, while others, with the apostles.","5":"And when an attempt was made by both the Gentiles and the Jews with their rulers, to treat them abusively and to stone them,","6":"they became aware of it and fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the surrounding region;","7":"and there they continued to preach the gospel.","8":"In Lystra a man was sitting whose feet were incapacitated. He had been disabled from his mother’s womb, and had never walked.","9":"This man was listening to Paul as he spoke. Paul looked at him intently and saw that he had faith to be made well,","10":"and he said with a loud voice, “Stand upright on your feet!” And the man leaped up and began to walk.","11":"When the crowds saw what Paul had done, they raised their voice, saying in the Lycaonian language, “The gods have become like men and have come down to us!”","12":"And they began calling Barnabas, Zeus, and Paul, Hermes, since he was the chief speaker.","13":"Moreover, the priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and wanted to offer sacrifice with the crowds.","14":"But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard about it, they tore their robes and rushed out into the crowd, crying out","15":"and saying, “Men, why are you doing these things? We are also men, of the same nature as you, preaching the gospel to you, to turn from these useless things to a living God, who MADE THE HEAVEN AND THE EARTH AND THE SEA, AND EVERYTHING THAT IS IN THEM.","16":"“In past generations He permitted all the nations to go their own ways;","17":"yet He did not leave Himself without witness, in that He did good and gave you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness.”","18":"And even by saying these things, only with difficulty did they restrain the crowds from offering sacrifices to them.","19":"But Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and having won over the crowds, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, thinking that he was dead.","20":"But while the disciples stood around him, he got up and entered the city. The next day he left with Barnabas for Derbe.","21":"And after they had preached the gospel to that city and had made a good number of disciples, they returned to Lystra, to Iconium, and to Antioch,","22":"strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the faith, and saying, “It is through many tribulations that we must enter the kingdom of God.”","23":"When they had appointed elders for them in every church, having prayed with fasting, they entrusted them to the Lord in whom they had believed.","24":"They passed through Pisidia and came into Pamphylia.","25":"When they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.","26":"From there they sailed to Antioch, where they had been entrusted to the grace of God for the work that they had accomplished.","27":"When they had arrived and gathered the church together, they began to report all the things that God had done with them and how He had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles.","28":"And they spent a long time with the disciples."},"15":{"1":"Some men came down from Judea and began teaching the brothers, “Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.”","2":"And after Paul and Barnabas had a heated argument and debate with them, the brothers determined that Paul and Barnabas and some others of them should go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders concerning this issue.","3":"Therefore, after being sent on their way by the church, they were passing through both Phoenicia and Samaria, describing in detail the conversion of the Gentiles, and they were bringing great joy to all the brothers and sisters.","4":"When they arrived in Jerusalem, they were received by the church, the apostles, and the elders, and they reported all that God had done with them.","5":"But some of the sect of the Pharisees who had believed stood up, saying, “It is necessary to circumcise them and to direct them to keep the Law of Moses.”","6":"The apostles and the elders came together to look into this matter.","7":"After there had been much debate, Peter stood up and said to them, “Brothers, you know that in the early days God made a choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles would hear the word of the gospel and believe.","8":"“And God, who knows the heart, testified to them giving them the Holy Spirit, just as He also did to us;","9":"and He made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith.","10":"“Since this is the case, why are you putting God to the test by placing upon the neck of the disciples a yoke which neither our forefathers nor we have been able to bear?","11":"“But we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, in the same way as they also are.”","12":"All the people kept silent, and they were listening to Barnabas and Paul as they were relating all the signs and wonders that God had done through them among the Gentiles.","13":"After they stopped speaking, James responded, saying, “Brothers, listen to me.","14":"“Simeon has described how God first concerned Himself about taking a people for His name from among the Gentiles.","15":"“The words of the Prophets agree with this, just as it is written:","16":"‘AFTER THESE THINGS I will return,\nAND I WILL REBUILD THE FALLEN TABERNACLE OF DAVID,\nAND I WILL REBUILD ITS RUINS,\nAND I WILL RESTORE IT,","17":"SO THAT THE REST OF MANKIND MAY SEEK THE LORD,\nAND ALL THE GENTILES WHO ARE CALLED BY MY NAME,’","18":"SAYS THE LORD, WHO MAKES THESE THINGS known from long ago.","19":"“Therefore, it is my judgment that we do not cause trouble for those from the Gentiles who are turning to God,","20":"but that we write to them that they abstain from things contaminated by idols, from acts of sexual immorality, from what has been strangled, and from blood.","21":"“For from ancient generations Moses has those who preach him in every city, since he is read in the synagogues every Sabbath.”","22":"Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men from among them to send to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas: Judas who was called Barsabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brothers,","23":"and they sent this letter with them:\n“The apostles and the brothers who are elders, to the brothers and sisters in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia who are from the Gentiles: Greetings.","24":"Since we have heard that some of our number to whom we gave no instruction have confused you by their teaching, upsetting your souls,","25":"it seemed good to us, having become of one mind, to select men to send to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,","26":"men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.","27":"Therefore, we have sent Judas and Silas, who themselves will also report the same things by word of mouth.","28":"For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these essentials:","29":"that you abstain from things sacrificed to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from acts of sexual immorality; if you keep yourselves free from such things, you will do well. Farewell.”","30":"So when they were sent away, they went down to Antioch; and after gathering the congregation together, they delivered the letter.","31":"When they had read it, they rejoiced because of its encouragement.","32":"Judas and Silas, also being prophets themselves, encouraged and strengthened the brothers and sisters with a lengthy message.","33":"After they had spent time there, they were sent away from the brothers and sisters in peace to those who had sent them out.","34":"","35":"But Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.","36":"After some days Paul said to Barnabas, “Let’s return and visit the brothers and sisters in every city in which we proclaimed the word of the Lord, and see how they are.”","37":"Barnabas wanted to take John, called Mark, along with them also.","38":"But Paul was of the opinion that they should not take along with them this man who had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not gone with them to the work.","39":"Now it turned into such a sharp disagreement that they separated from one another, and Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus.","40":"But Paul chose Silas, and left after being entrusted by the brothers to the grace of the Lord.","41":"And he was traveling through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches."},"16":{"1":"Now Paul also came to Derbe and to Lystra. And a disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer, but his father was a Greek,","2":"and he was well spoken of by the brothers and sisters who were in Lystra and Iconium.","3":"Paul wanted this man to leave with him; and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those parts, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.","4":"Now while they were passing through the cities, they were delivering the ordinances for them to follow which had been determined by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem.","5":"So the churches were being strengthened in the faith, and were increasing in number daily.","6":"They passed through the Phrygian and Galatian region, after being forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia;","7":"and after they came to Mysia, they were trying to go into Bithynia, and the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them;","8":"and passing by Mysia, they went down to Troas.","9":"And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: a man of Macedonia was standing and pleading with him, and saying, “Come over to Macedonia and help us.”","10":"When he had seen the vision, we immediately sought to leave for Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.","11":"So after setting sail from Troas, we ran a straight course to Samothrace, and on the following day to Neapolis;","12":"and from there to Philippi, which is a leading city of the district of Macedonia, a Roman colony; and we were spending some days in this city.","13":"And on the Sabbath day we went outside the gate to a riverside, where we were thinking that there was a place of prayer; and we sat down and began speaking to the women who had assembled.","14":"A woman named Lydia was listening; she was a seller of purple fabrics from the city of Thyatira, and a worshiper of God. The Lord opened her heart to respond to the things spoken by Paul.","15":"Now when she and her household had been baptized, she urged us, saying, “If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and stay.” And she prevailed upon us.","16":"It happened that as we were going to the place of prayer, a slave woman who had a spirit of divination met us, who was bringing great profit to her masters by fortune-telling.","17":"She followed Paul and us and cried out repeatedly, saying, “These men are bond-servants of the Most High God, who are proclaiming to you a way of salvation.”","18":"Now she continued doing this for many days. But Paul was greatly annoyed, and he turned and said to the spirit, “I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her!” And it came out at that very moment.","19":"But when her masters saw that their hope of profit was suddenly gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the authorities,","20":"and when they had brought them to the chief magistrates, they said, “These men, Jews as they are, are causing our city trouble,","21":"and they are proclaiming customs that are not lawful for us to accept or to practice, since we are Romans.”","22":"The crowd joined in an attack against them, and the chief magistrates tore their robes off them and proceeded to order them to be beaten with rods.","23":"When they had struck them with many blows, they threw them into prison, commanding the jailer to guard them securely;","24":"and he, having received such a command, threw them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.","25":"Now about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns of praise to God, and the prisoners were listening to them;","26":"and suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened, and everyone’s chains were unfastened.","27":"When the jailer awoke and saw the prison doors opened, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, thinking that the prisoners had escaped.","28":"But Paul called out with a loud voice, saying, “Do not harm yourself, for we are all here!”","29":"And the jailer asked for lights and rushed in, and trembling with fear, he fell down before Paul and Silas;","30":"and after he brought them out, he said, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?”","31":"They said, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.”","32":"And they spoke the word of God to him together with all who were in his house.","33":"And he took them that very hour of the night and washed their wounds, and immediately he was baptized, he and all his household.","34":"And he brought them into his house and set food before them, and was overjoyed, since he had become a believer in God together with his whole household.","35":"Now when day came, the chief magistrates sent their officers, saying, “Release those men.”","36":"And the jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, “The chief magistrates have sent word that you be released. So come out now and go in peace.”","37":"But Paul said to them, “After beating us in public without due process—men who are Romans—they threw us into prison; and now they are releasing us secretly? No indeed! On the contrary, let them come in person and lead us out.”","38":"The officers reported these words to the chief magistrates. And they became fearful when they heard that they were Romans,","39":"and they came and pleaded with them, and when they had led them out, they repeatedly asked them to leave the city.","40":"They left the prison and entered the house of Lydia, and when they saw the brothers and sisters, they encouraged them and departed."},"17":{"1":"Now when they had traveled through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.","2":"And according to Paul’s custom, he visited them, and for three Sabbaths reasoned with them from the Scriptures,","3":"explaining and giving evidence that the Christ had to suffer and rise from the dead, and saying, “This Jesus whom I am proclaiming to you is the Christ.”","4":"And some of them were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, along with a large number of the God-fearing Greeks and a significant number of the leading women.","5":"But the Jews, becoming jealous and taking along some wicked men from the marketplace, formed a mob and set the city in an uproar; and they attacked the house of Jason and were seeking to bring them out to the people.","6":"When they did not find them, they began dragging Jason and some brothers before the city authorities, shouting, “These men who have upset the world have come here also;","7":"and Jason has welcomed them, and they all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus.”","8":"They stirred up the crowd and the city authorities who heard these things.","9":"And when they had received a pledge from Jason and the others, they released them.","10":"The brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea, and when they arrived, they went into the synagogue of the Jews.","11":"Now these people were more noble-minded than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with great eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so.","12":"Therefore, many of them believed, along with a significant number of prominent Greek women and men.","13":"But when the Jews of Thessalonica found out that the word of God had been proclaimed by Paul in Berea also, they came there as well, agitating and stirring up the crowds.","14":"Then immediately the brothers sent Paul out to go as far as the sea; and Silas and Timothy remained there.","15":"Now those who escorted Paul brought him as far as Athens; and receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible, they left.","16":"Now while Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was being provoked within him as he observed that the city was full of idols.","17":"So he was reasoning in the synagogue with the Jews and the God-fearing Gentiles, and in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be present.","18":"And some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers as well were conversing with him. Some were saying, “What could this scavenger of tidbits want to say?” Others, “He seems to be a proclaimer of strange deities,”—because he was preaching Jesus and the resurrection.","19":"And they took him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, “May we know what this new teaching is which you are proclaiming?","20":"“For you are bringing some strange things to our ears; so we want to know what these things mean.”","21":"(Now all the Athenians and the strangers visiting there used to spend their time in nothing other than telling or hearing something new.)","22":"So Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus and said, “Men of Athens, I see that you are very religious in all respects.","23":"“For while I was passing through and examining the objects of your worship, I also found an altar with this inscription, ‘TO AN UNKNOWN GOD.’ Therefore, what you worship in ignorance, this I proclaim to you.","24":"“The God who made the world and everything that is in it, since He is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made by hands;","25":"nor is He served by human hands, as though He needed anything, since He Himself gives to all people life and breath and all things;","26":"and He made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their habitation,","27":"that they would seek God, if perhaps they might feel around for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us;","28":"for in Him we live and move and exist, as even some of your own poets have said, ‘For we also are His descendants.’","29":"“Therefore, since we are the descendants of God, we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by human skill and thought.","30":"“So having overlooked the times of ignorance, God is now proclaiming to mankind that all people everywhere are to repent,","31":"because He has set a day on which He will judge the world in righteousness through a Man whom He has appointed, having furnished proof to all people by raising Him from the dead.”","32":"Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some began to scoff, but others said, “We shall hear from you again concerning this.”","33":"So Paul went out from among them.","34":"But some men joined him and believed, among whom also were Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris, and others with them."},"18":{"1":"After these events Paul left Athens and went to Corinth.","2":"And he found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus having recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to leave Rome. He came to them,","3":"and because he was of the same trade he stayed with them, and they worked together, for they were tent-makers by trade.","4":"And Paul was reasoning in the synagogue every Sabbath and trying to persuade Jews and Greeks.","5":"But when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul began devoting himself completely to the word, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.","6":"But when they resisted and blasphemed, he shook out his garments and said to them, “Your blood is on your own heads! I am clean. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.”","7":"Then he left the synagogue and went to the house of a man named Titius Justus, a worshiper of God, whose house was next door to the synagogue.","8":"Crispus, the leader of the synagogue, believed in the Lord together with his entire household; and many of the Corinthians, as they listened to Paul, were believing and being baptized.","9":"And the Lord said to Paul by a vision at night, “Do not be afraid any longer, but go on speaking and do not be silent;","10":"for I am with you, and no one will attack you to harm you, for I have many people in this city.”","11":"And he settled there for a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.","12":"But while Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews rose up together against Paul and brought him before the judgment seat,","13":"saying, “This man is inciting the people to worship God contrary to the law.”","14":"But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, “If it were a matter of some crime or vicious, unscrupulous act, O Jews, it would be reasonable for me to put up with you;","15":"but if there are questions about teaching and persons and your own law, see to it yourselves; I am unwilling to be a judge of these matters.”","16":"And he drove them away from the judgment seat.","17":"But they all took hold of Sosthenes, the leader of the synagogue, and began beating him in front of the judgment seat. And yet Gallio was not concerned about any of these things.","18":"Now Paul, when he had remained many days longer, took leave of the brothers and sisters and sailed away to Syria, and Priscilla and Aquila were with him. Paul first had his hair cut at Cenchrea, for he was keeping a vow.","19":"They came to Ephesus, and he left them there. Now he himself entered the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.","20":"When they asked him to stay for a longer time, he did not consent,","21":"but took leave of them and said, “I will return to you again if God wills,” and he set sail from Ephesus.","22":"When he had landed in Caesarea, he went up to Jerusalem and greeted the church, and went down to Antioch.","23":"And after spending some time there, he left and passed successively through the Galatian region and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.","24":"Now a Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus; and he was proficient in the Scriptures.","25":"This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he was accurately speaking and teaching things about Jesus, being acquainted only with the baptism of John;","26":"and he began speaking boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and explained the way of God more accurately to him.","27":"And when he wanted to go across to Achaia, the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him; and when he had arrived, he greatly helped those who had believed through grace,","28":"for he powerfully refuted the Jews in public, demonstrating by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ."},"19":{"1":"Now it happened that while Apollos was in Corinth, Paul passed through the upper country and came to Ephesus, and found some disciples.","2":"He said to them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?” And they said to him, “On the contrary, we have not even heard if there is a Holy Spirit.”","3":"And he said, “Into what then were you baptized?” And they said, “Into John’s baptism.”","4":"Paul said, “John baptized with a baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in Him who was coming after him, that is, in Jesus.”","5":"When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.","6":"And when Paul had laid hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them and they began speaking with tongues and prophesying.","7":"There were about twelve men in all.","8":"And he entered the synagogue and continued speaking out boldly for three months, having discussions and persuading them about the kingdom of God.","9":"But when some were becoming hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of the Way before the people, he withdrew from them and took the disciples away with him, and had discussions daily in the school of Tyrannus.","10":"This took place for two years, so that all who lived in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.","11":"God was performing extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul,","12":"so that handkerchiefs or aprons were even carried from his body to the sick, and the diseases left them and the evil spirits went out.","13":"But also some of the Jewish exorcists, who went from place to place, attempted to use the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had the evil spirits, saying, “I order you in the name of Jesus whom Paul preaches!”","14":"Now there were seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, doing this.","15":"But the evil spirit responded and said to them, “I recognize Jesus, and I know of Paul, but who are you?”","16":"And the man in whom was the evil spirit, pounced on them and subdued all of them and overpowered them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.","17":"This became known to all who lived in Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks; and fear fell upon them all and the name of the Lord Jesus was being magnified.","18":"Also many of those who had believed kept coming, confessing and disclosing their practices.","19":"And many of those who practiced magic brought their books together and began burning them in the sight of everyone; and they added up the prices of the books and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver.","20":"So the word of the Lord was growing and prevailing mightily.","21":"Now after these things were finished, Paul resolved in the Spirit to go to Jerusalem after he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, saying, “After I have been there, I must also see Rome.”","22":"And after he sent into Macedonia two of those who assisted him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while.","23":"About that time a major disturbance occurred in regard to the Way.","24":"For a man named Demetrius, a silversmith who made silver shrines of Artemis, was bringing considerable business to the craftsmen;","25":"he gathered these men together with the workmen of similar trades, and said, “Men, you know that our prosperity depends upon this business.","26":"“You see and hear that not only in Ephesus, but in almost all of Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away a considerable number of people, saying that gods made by hands are not gods at all.","27":"“Not only is there danger that this trade of ours will fall into disrepute, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be regarded as worthless, and that she whom all of Asia and the world worship will even be dethroned from her magnificence.”","28":"When they heard this and were filled with rage, they began shouting, saying, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”","29":"The city was filled with the confusion, and they rushed together into the theater, dragging along Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul’s Macedonian traveling companions.","30":"And when Paul wanted to go into the assembly, the disciples would not let him.","31":"Also some of the Asiarchs who were friends of his sent word to him and repeatedly urged him not to venture into the theater.","32":"So then, some were shouting one thing and some another, for the assembly was in confusion and the majority did not know for what reason they had come together.","33":"Some of the crowd concluded it was Alexander, since the Jews had put him forward; and having motioned with his hand, Alexander was intending to make a defense to the assembly.","34":"But when they recognized that he was a Jew, a single outcry arose from them all as they shouted for about two hours, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”","35":"After quieting the crowd, the town clerk *said, “Men of Ephesus, what person is there after all who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of the image which fell down from the sky?","36":"“So, since these are undeniable facts, you ought to keep calm and to do nothing rash.","37":"“For you have brought these men here who are neither temple robbers nor blasphemers of our goddess.","38":"“So then, if Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have a complaint against anyone, the courts are in session and proconsuls are available; have them bring charges against one another.","39":"“But if you want anything beyond this, it shall be settled in the lawful assembly.","40":"“For indeed, we are in danger of being accused of a riot in connection with today’s events, since there is no real reason for it, and in this connection we will be unable to account for this disorderly gathering.”","41":"After saying this he dismissed the assembly."},"20":{"1":"After the uproar had ceased, Paul sent for the disciples, and when he had encouraged them and taken his leave of them, he left to go to Macedonia.","2":"When he had gone through those regions and had given them much encouragement, he came to Greece.","3":"And there he spent three months, and when a plot was formed against him by the Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he decided to return through Macedonia.","4":"And he was accompanied by Sopater of Berea, the son of Pyrrhus, and by Aristarchus and Secundus of the Thessalonians, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia.","5":"Now these had gone on ahead and were waiting for us at Troas.","6":"We sailed from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread, and reached them at Troas within five days; and we stayed there for seven days.","7":"On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul began talking to them, intending to leave the next day, and he prolonged his message until midnight.","8":"There were many lamps in the upstairs room where we were gathered together.","9":"And there was a young man named Eutychus sitting on the window sill, sinking into a deep sleep; and as Paul kept on talking, Eutychus was overcome by sleep and fell down from the third floor, and was picked up dead.","10":"But Paul went down and fell upon him, and after embracing him, he said, “Do not be troubled, for he is still alive.”","11":"When Paul had gone back up and had broken the bread and eaten, he talked with them a long while until daybreak, and then left.","12":"They took away the boy alive, and were greatly comforted.","13":"But we went ahead to the ship and set sail for Assos, intending from there to take Paul on board; for that was what he had arranged, intending himself to go by land.","14":"And when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and came to Mitylene.","15":"Sailing from there, we arrived the following day opposite Chios; and the next day we crossed over to Samos, and on the following day we came to Miletus.","16":"For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus so that he would not have to lose time in Asia; for he was hurrying, if it might be possible for him to be in Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.","17":"From Miletus he sent word to Ephesus and called to himself the elders of the church.","18":"And when they came to him, he said to them,\n“You yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, how I was with you the whole time,","19":"serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and trials which came upon me through the plots of the Jews;","20":"how I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was beneficial, and teaching you publicly and from house to house,","21":"solemnly testifying to both Jews and Greeks of repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.","22":"“And now, behold, bound by the Spirit, I am on my way to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there,","23":"except that the Holy Spirit solemnly testifies to me in every city, saying that chains and afflictions await me.","24":"“But I do not consider my life of any account as dear to myself, so that I may finish my course and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify solemnly of the gospel of God’s grace.","25":"“And now behold, I know that all of you, among whom I went about preaching the kingdom, will no longer see my face.","26":"“Therefore, I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all people.","27":"“For I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole purpose of God.","28":"“Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God which He purchased with His own blood.","29":"“I know that after my departure savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock;","30":"and from among your own selves men will arise, speaking perverse things to draw away the disciples after them.","31":"“Therefore, be on the alert, remembering that night and day for a period of three years I did not cease to admonish each one with tears.","32":"“And now I entrust you to God and to the word of His grace, which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified.","33":"“I have coveted no one’s silver or gold or clothes.","34":"“You yourselves know that these hands served my own needs and the men who were with me.","35":"“In everything I showed you that by working hard in this way you must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that He Himself said, ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’”","36":"When he had said these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all.","37":"And they all began to weep aloud and embraced Paul, and repeatedly kissed him,","38":"grieving especially over the word which he had spoken, that they would not see his face again. And they were accompanying him to the ship."},"21":{"1":"Now when we had parted from them and had set sail, we ran a straight course to Cos, and on the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara;","2":"and having found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, we went aboard and set sail.","3":"When we came in sight of Cyprus, leaving it on the left, we kept sailing to Syria and landed at Tyre; for the ship was to unload its cargo there.","4":"After looking up the disciples, we stayed there for seven days; and they kept telling Paul, through the Spirit, not to set foot in Jerusalem.","5":"When our days there were ended, we left and started on our journey, while they all, with wives and children, escorted us until we were out of the city. After kneeling down on the beach and praying, we said farewell to one another.","6":"Then we boarded the ship, and they returned home.","7":"When we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais, and after greeting the brothers and sisters, we stayed with them for a day.","8":"On the next day we left and came to Caesarea, and we entered the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, and stayed with him.","9":"Now this man had four virgin daughters who were prophetesses.","10":"As we were staying there for some days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.","11":"And he came to us and took Paul’s belt and bound his own feet and hands, and said, “This is what the Holy Spirit says: ‘In this way the Jews in Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and hand him over to the Gentiles.’”","12":"When we had heard this, we as well as the local residents began begging him not to go up to Jerusalem.","13":"Then Paul replied, “What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but even to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.”","14":"And since he would not be persuaded, we became quiet, remarking, “The will of the Lord be done!”","15":"After these days we got ready and started on our way up to Jerusalem.","16":"Some of the disciples from Caesarea also came with us, taking us to Mnason of Cyprus, a disciple of long standing with whom we were to stay.","17":"After we arrived in Jerusalem, the brothers and sisters received us gladly.","18":"And the following day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present.","19":"After he had greeted them, he began to relate one by one the things which God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.","20":"And when they heard about them, they began glorifying God; and they said to him, “You see, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed, and they are all zealous for the Law;","21":"and they have been told about you, that you are teaching all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to abandon Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children nor to walk according to the customs.","22":"“So what is to be done? They will certainly hear that you have come.","23":"“Therefore, do as we tell you: we have four men who have a vow upon themselves;","24":"take them along and purify yourself together with them, and pay their expenses so that they may shave their heads; and then everyone will know that there is nothing to what they have been told about you, but that you yourself also conform, keeping the Law.","25":"“But regarding the Gentiles who have believed, we sent a letter, having decided that they should abstain from meat sacrificed to idols and from blood and what is strangled, and from sexual immorality.”","26":"Then Paul took along the men, and the next day, after purifying himself together with them, he went into the temple giving notice of the completion of the days of purification, until the sacrifice was offered for each one of them.","27":"When the seven days were almost over, the Jews from Asia, upon seeing him in the temple, began to stir up all the crowd and laid hands on him,","28":"crying out, “Men of Israel, help! This is the man who instructs everyone everywhere against our people and the Law and this place; and besides, he has even brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place!”","29":"For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him, and they thought that Paul had brought him into the temple.","30":"Then the whole city was provoked and the people rushed together, and taking hold of Paul they dragged him out of the temple, and immediately the doors were shut.","31":"While they were intent on killing him, a report came up to the commander of the Roman cohort that all Jerusalem was in confusion.","32":"He immediately took along some soldiers and centurions and ran down to the crowd; and when they saw the commander and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.","33":"Then the commander came up and took hold of him, and ordered that he be bound with two chains; and he began asking who he was and what he had done.","34":"But among the crowd, some were shouting one thing and some another, and when he could not find out the facts because of the uproar, he ordered that Paul be brought into the barracks.","35":"When Paul got to the stairs, it came about that he was carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the mob;","36":"for the multitude of people kept following them, shouting, “Away with him!”","37":"As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he *said to the commander, “May I say something to you?” And he said, “Do you know Greek?","38":"“Then you are not the Egyptian who some time ago stirred up a revolt and led the four thousand men of the Assassins out into the wilderness?”","39":"But Paul said, “I am a Jew of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no insignificant city; and I beg you, allow me to speak to the people.”","40":"When he had given him permission, Paul, standing on the stairs, motioned to the people with his hand; and when there was a great silence, he spoke to them in the Hebrew dialect, saying,"},"22":{"1":"“Brothers and fathers, hear my defense which I now offer to you.”","2":"And when they heard that he was addressing them in the Hebrew dialect, they became even more quiet; and he *said,","3":"“I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city, educated under Gamaliel, strictly according to the Law of our fathers, being zealous for God just as you all are today.","4":"“I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and putting both men and women into prisons,","5":"as also the high priest and all the Council of the elders can testify. From them I also received letters to the brothers, and started off for Damascus in order to bring even those who were there to Jerusalem as prisoners to be punished.","6":"“But it happened that as I was on my way, approaching Damascus at about noon, a very bright light suddenly flashed from heaven all around me,","7":"and I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?’","8":"“And I answered, ‘Who are You, Lord?’ And He said to me, ‘I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom you are persecuting.’","9":"“And those who were with me saw the light, but did not understand the voice of the One who was speaking to me.","10":"“And I said, ‘What shall I do, Lord?’ And the Lord said to me, ‘Get up and go on into Damascus, and there you will be told about everything that has been appointed for you to do.’","11":"“But since I could not see because of the brightness of that light, I came into Damascus being led by the hand by those who were with me.","12":"“Now a certain Ananias, a man who was devout by the standard of the Law and well spoken of by all the Jews who lived there,","13":"came to me, and standing nearby he said to me, ‘Brother Saul, receive your sight!’ And at that very moment I looked up at him.","14":"“And he said, ‘The God of our fathers has appointed you to know His will and to see the Righteous One and to hear a message from His mouth.","15":"‘For you will be a witness for Him to all people of what you have seen and heard.","16":"‘Now why do you delay? Get up and be baptized, and wash away your sins by calling on His name.’","17":"“It happened when I returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, that I fell into a trance,","18":"and I saw Him saying to me, ‘Hurry and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about Me.’","19":"“And I said, ‘Lord, they themselves understand that in one synagogue after another I used to imprison and beat those who believed in You.","20":"‘And when the blood of Your witness Stephen was being shed, I also was standing nearby and approving, and watching over the cloaks of those who were killing him.’","21":"“And He said to me, ‘Go! For I will send you far away to the Gentiles.’”","22":"They listened to him up to this statement, and then they raised their voices and said, “Away with such a man from the earth, for he should not be allowed to live!”","23":"And as they were shouting and throwing off their cloaks and tossing dust into the air,","24":"the commander ordered that he be brought into the barracks, saying that he was to be interrogated by flogging so that he would find out the reason why they were shouting against him that way.","25":"But when they stretched him out with straps, Paul said to the centurion who was standing by, “Is it lawful for you to flog a man who is a Roman and uncondemned?”","26":"When the centurion heard this, he went to the commander and told him, saying, “What are you about to do? For this man is a Roman.”","27":"The commander came and said to Paul, “Tell me, are you a Roman?” And he said, “Yes.”","28":"The commander answered, “I acquired this citizenship for a large sum of money.” And Paul said, “But I was actually born a citizen.”","29":"Therefore, those who were about to interrogate him immediately backed away from him; and the commander also was afraid when he found out that he was a Roman, and because he had put him in chains.","30":"Now on the next day, wanting to know for certain why Paul had been accused by the Jews, he released him and ordered the chief priests and all the Council to assemble, and he brought Paul down and placed him before them."},"23":{"1":"Now looking intently at the Council, Paul said, “Brothers, I have lived my life with an entirely good conscience before God up to this day.”","2":"But the high priest Ananias commanded those standing beside him to strike him on the mouth.","3":"Then Paul said to him, “God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall! Do you sit to try me according to the Law, and in violation of the Law, order me to be struck?”","4":"But those present said, “Are you insulting God’s high priest?”","5":"And Paul said, “I was not aware, brothers, that he is high priest; for it is written: ‘YOU SHALL NOT SPEAK EVIL OF A RULER OF YOUR PEOPLE.’”","6":"But Paul, perceiving that one group were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, began crying out in the Council, “Brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees; I am on trial for the hope and resurrection of the dead!”","7":"When he said this, a dissension occurred between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.","8":"For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor an angel, nor a spirit, but the Pharisees acknowledge them all.","9":"And a great uproar occurred; and some of the scribes of the Pharisaic party stood up and started arguing heatedly, saying, “We find nothing wrong with this man; suppose a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?”","10":"And when a great dissension occurred, the commander was afraid that Paul would be torn to pieces by them, and he ordered the troops to go down and take him away from them by force, and bring him into the barracks.","11":"But on the following night, the Lord stood near him and said, “Be courageous! For as you have testified to the truth about Me in Jerusalem, so you must testify in Rome also.”","12":"When it was day, the Jews formed a conspiracy and put themselves under an oath, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.","13":"There were more than forty who formed this plot.","14":"They came to the chief priests and the elders and said, “We have put ourselves under an oath to taste nothing until we have killed Paul.","15":"“Now therefore, you and the Council notify the commander to bring him down to you, as though you were going to investigate his case more thoroughly; and as for us, we are ready to kill him before he comes near the place.”","16":"But the son of Paul’s sister heard about their ambush, and he came and entered the barracks and told Paul.","17":"Paul called one of the centurions to himself and said, “Take this young man to the commander, for he has something to report to him.”","18":"So he took him and led him to the commander and *said, “Paul the prisoner called me over to him and asked me to bring this young man to you because he has something to tell you.”","19":"The commander took him by the hand, and stepping aside, began to inquire of him privately, “What is it that you have to report to me?”","20":"And he said, “The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down tomorrow to the Council, as though they were going to inquire somewhat more thoroughly about him.","21":"“So do not listen to them, for more than forty of them are in hiding to ambush him, and these men have put themselves under an oath not to eat or drink until they kill him; and now they are ready and waiting for assurance from you.”","22":"Then the commander let the young man go, instructing him, “Tell no one that you have notified me of these things.”","23":"And he called to him two of the centurions and said, “Get two hundred soldiers ready by the third hour of the night to proceed to Caesarea, with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen.”","24":"They were also to provide mounts to put Paul on and bring him safely to Felix the governor.","25":"And he wrote a letter with the following content:","26":"“Claudius Lysias, to the most excellent governor Felix: Greetings.","27":"When this man was seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them, I came up to them with the troops and rescued him, after learning that he was a Roman.","28":"And wanting to ascertain the basis for the charges they were bringing against him, I brought him down to their Council;","29":"and I found that he was being accused regarding questions in their Law, but was not charged with anything deserving death or imprisonment.","30":"When I was informed that there would be a plot against the man, I sent him to you at once, also instructing his accusers to bring charges against him before you.”","31":"So the soldiers, in accordance with their orders, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.","32":"But on the next day they let the horsemen go on with him, and they returned to the barracks.","33":"When these horsemen had come to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Paul to him.","34":"Now when he had read it, he also asked from what province Paul was, and when he learned that he was from Cilicia,","35":"he said, “I will give you a hearing when your accusers arrive as well,” giving orders for Paul to be kept in Herod’s Praetorium."},"24":{"1":"Now after five days the high priest Ananias came down with some elders and an attorney named Tertullus, and they brought charges against Paul to the governor.","2":"After Paul had been summoned, Tertullus began accusing him, saying to the governor,\n“Since we have attained great peace through you, and since reforms are being carried out for this nation by your foresight,","3":"we acknowledge this in every way and everywhere, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.","4":"“But, that I may not weary you further, I beg you to grant us a brief hearing, by your kindness.","5":"“For we have found this man a public menace and one who stirs up dissensions among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.","6":"“And he even tried to desecrate the temple, so indeed we arrested him.","7":"","8":"By interrogating him yourself concerning all these matters, you will be able to ascertain the things of which we are accusing him.”","9":"The Jews also joined in the attack, asserting that these things were so.","10":"And when the governor had nodded for him to speak, Paul responded:\n“Knowing that for many years you have been a judge to this nation, I cheerfully make my defense,","11":"since you can take note of the fact that no more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship.","12":"“And neither in the temple did they find me carrying on a discussion with anyone or causing a riot, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city itself.","13":"“Nor can they prove to you the things of which they now accuse me.","14":"“But I confess this to you, that in accordance with the Way, which they call a sect, I do serve the God of our fathers, believing everything that is in accordance with the Law and is written in the Prophets;","15":"having a hope in God, which these men cherish themselves, that there shall certainly be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked.","16":"“In view of this I also do my best to maintain a blameless conscience both before God and before other people, always.","17":"“Now after several years I came to bring charitable gifts to my nation and to present offerings,","18":"in which they found me occupied in the temple, having been purified, without any crowd or uproar. But there were some Jews from Asia—","19":"who ought to have been present before you and to have been bringing charges, if they should have anything against me.","20":"“Or else have these men themselves declare what violation they discovered when I stood before the Council,","21":"other than in regard to this one declaration which I shouted while standing among them, ‘For the resurrection of the dead I am on trial before you today!’”","22":"But Felix, having quite accurate knowledge about the Way, adjourned them, saying, “When Lysias the commander comes down, I will decide your case.”","23":"He gave orders to the centurion for Paul to be kept in custody and yet have some freedom, and not to prevent any of his friends from providing for his needs.","24":"Now some days later Felix arrived with Drusilla his wife, who was Jewish, and he sent for Paul and heard him speak about faith in Christ Jesus.","25":"But as he was discussing righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix became frightened and responded, “Go away for now, and when I have an opportunity, I will summon you.”","26":"At the same time he was also hoping that money would be given to him by Paul; therefore he also used to send for him quite often and talk with him.","27":"But after two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and Felix, wanting to do the Jews a favor, left Paul imprisoned."},"25":{"1":"Festus, then, after arriving in the province, went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea three days later.","2":"And the chief priests and the leading men of the Jews brought charges against Paul, and they were pleading with Festus,","3":"requesting a concession against Paul, that he might have him brought to Jerusalem (at the same time, setting an ambush to kill him on the way).","4":"Festus then answered that Paul was being kept in custody in Caesarea, and that he himself was about to leave shortly.","5":"“Therefore,” he *said, “have the influential men among you go there with me, and if there is anything wrong about the man, have them bring charges against him.”","6":"After Festus had spent no more than eight or ten days among them, he went down to Caesarea, and on the next day he took his seat on the tribunal and ordered that Paul be brought.","7":"After Paul arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many, and serious, charges against him which they could not prove,","8":"while Paul said in his own defense, “I have not done anything wrong either against the Law of the Jews, or against the temple, or against Caesar.”","9":"But Festus, wanting to do the Jews a favor, replied to Paul and said, “Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and stand trial before me on these charges?”","10":"But Paul said, “I am standing before Caesar’s tribunal, where I ought to be tried. I have done nothing wrong to the Jews, as you also very well know.","11":"“If, therefore, I am in the wrong and have committed something deserving death, I am not trying to avoid execution; but if there is nothing to the accusations which these men are bringing against me, no one can hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar.”","12":"Then when Festus had conferred with his council, he answered, “You have appealed to Caesar; to Caesar you shall go.”","13":"Now when several days had passed, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived in Caesarea, paying their respects to Festus.","14":"And while they were spending many days there, Festus presented Paul’s case to the king, saying, “There is a man who was left as a prisoner by Felix;","15":"and when I was in Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews brought charges against him, asking for a sentence of condemnation against him.","16":"“I replied to them that it is not the custom of the Romans to hand over any person before the accused meets his accusers face to face, and has an opportunity to make his defense against the charges.","17":"“So after they had assembled here, I did not delay, but on the next day took my seat on the tribunal and ordered that the man be brought.","18":"“When the accusers stood up, they did not begin bringing any charges against him of crimes that I suspected,","19":"but they simply had some points of disagreement with him about their own religion and about a dead man, Jesus, whom Paul asserted to be alive.","20":"“And being at a loss how to investigate such matters, I asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem and stand trial there on these matters.","21":"“But when Paul appealed to be held in custody for the Emperor’s decision, I ordered that he be kept in custody until I send him to Caesar.”","22":"Then Agrippa said to Festus, “I also would like to hear the man myself.” “Tomorrow,” he *said, “you shall hear him.”","23":"So, on the next day when Agrippa and Bernice came amid great pomp and entered the auditorium, accompanied by the commanders and the prominent men of the city, at the command of Festus, Paul was brought before them.","24":"And Festus *said, “King Agrippa, and all you gentlemen present with us, you see this man about whom all the people of the Jews appealed to me, both in Jerusalem and here, shouting that he ought not to live any longer.","25":"“But I found that he had committed nothing deserving death; and since he himself appealed to the Emperor, I decided to send him.","26":"“Yet, I have nothing definite about him to write to my lord. Therefore, I have brought him before you all and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that after the investigation has taken place, I may have something to write.","27":"“For it seems absurd to me in sending a prisoner, not to indicate the charges against him as well.”"},"26":{"1":"Now Agrippa said to Paul, “You are permitted to speak for yourself.” Then Paul extended his hand and proceeded to make his defense:","2":"“Regarding all the things of which I am accused by the Jews, King Agrippa, I consider myself fortunate that I am about to make my defense before you today,","3":"especially because you are an expert in all customs and questions among the Jews; therefore I beg you to listen to me patiently.","4":"“So then, all Jews know my way of life since my youth, which from the beginning was spent among my own nation and in Jerusalem,","5":"since they have known about me for a long time, if they are willing to testify, that I lived as a Pharisee according to the strictest sect of our religion.","6":"“And now I am standing trial for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers;","7":"the promise to which our twelve tribes hope to attain, as they earnestly serve God night and day. For this hope, O king, I am being accused by Jews.","8":"“Why is it considered incredible among you people if God raises the dead?","9":"“So I thought to myself that I had to act in strong opposition to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.","10":"“And this is just what I did in Jerusalem; not only did I lock up many of the saints in prisons, after receiving authority from the chief priests, but I also cast my vote against them when they were being put to death.","11":"“And as I punished them often in all the synagogues, I tried to force them to blaspheme; and since I was extremely enraged at them, I kept pursuing them even to foreign cities.","12":"“While so engaged, as I was journeying to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests,","13":"at midday, O king, I saw on the way a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining around me and those who were journeying with me.","14":"“And when we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew dialect, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.’","15":"“And I said, ‘Who are You, Lord?’ And the Lord said, ‘I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.","16":"‘But get up and stand on your feet; for this purpose I have appeared to you, to appoint you as a servant and a witness not only to the things in which you have seen Me, but also to the things in which I will appear to you,","17":"rescuing you from the Jewish people and from the Gentiles, to whom I am sending you,","18":"to open their eyes so that they may turn from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified by faith in Me.’","19":"“For that reason, King Agrippa, I did not prove disobedient to the heavenly vision,","20":"but continually proclaimed to those in Damascus first, and in Jerusalem, and then all the region of Judea, and even to the Gentiles, that they are to repent and turn to God, performing deeds consistent with repentance.","21":"“For these reasons some Jews seized me in the temple and tried to murder me.","22":"“So, having obtained help from God, I stand to this day testifying both to small and great, stating nothing but what the Prophets and Moses said was going to take place,","23":"as to whether the Christ was to suffer, and whether, as first from the resurrection of the dead, He would proclaim light both to the Jewish people and to the Gentiles.”","24":"While Paul was stating these things in his defense, Festus *said in a loud voice, “Paul, you are out of your mind! Your great learning is driving you insane.”","25":"But Paul *said, “I am not insane, most excellent Festus; on the contrary, I am speaking out with truthful and rational words.","26":"“For the king knows about these matters, and I also speak to him with confidence, since I am persuaded that none of these things escape his notice; for this has not been done in a corner.","27":"“King Agrippa, do you believe the Prophets? I know that you believe.”","28":"Agrippa replied to Paul, “In a short time you are going to persuade me to make a Christian of myself.”","29":"And Paul said, “I would wish to God that even in a short or long time not only you, but also all who hear me this day would become such as I myself am, except for these chains.”","30":"The king stood up and the governor and Bernice, and those who were sitting with them,","31":"and when they had gone out, they began talking to one another, saying, “This man is not doing anything deserving death or imprisonment.”","32":"And Agrippa said to Festus, “This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.”"},"27":{"1":"Now when it was decided that we would sail for Italy, they proceeded to turn Paul and some other prisoners over to a centurion of the Augustan cohort, named Julius.","2":"And we boarded an Adramyttian ship that was about to sail to the regions along the coast of Asia, and put out to sea accompanied by Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica.","3":"The next day we put in at Sidon; and Julius treated Paul with consideration and allowed him to go to his friends and receive care.","4":"From there we put out to sea and sailed under the shelter of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.","5":"When we had sailed through the sea along the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we landed at Myra in Lycia.","6":"There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy, and he put us aboard it.","7":"When we had sailed slowly for a good many days, and with difficulty had arrived off Cnidus, since the wind did not permit us to go farther, we sailed under the shelter of Crete, off Salmone;","8":"and with difficulty sailing past it, we came to a place called Fair Havens, near which was the city of Lasea.","9":"When considerable time had passed and the voyage was now dangerous, since even the fast was already over, Paul started admonishing them,","10":"saying to them, “Men, I perceive that the voyage will certainly be with damage and great loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.”","11":"But the centurion was more persuaded by the pilot and the captain of the ship than by what was being said by Paul.","12":"The harbor was not suitable for wintering, so the majority reached a decision to put out to sea from there, if somehow they could reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete facing southwest and northwest, and spend the winter there.","13":"When a moderate south wind came up, thinking that they had attained their purpose, they weighed anchor and began sailing along Crete, closer to shore.","14":"But before very long a violent wind, called Euraquilo, rushed down from the land;","15":"and when the ship was caught in it and could not head up into the wind, we gave up and let ourselves be driven by the wind.","16":"Running under the shelter of a small island called Cauda, we were able to get the ship’s boat under control only with difficulty.","17":"After they had hoisted it up, they used supporting cables in undergirding the ship; and fearing that they might run aground on the shallows of Syrtis, they let down the sea anchor and let themselves be driven along in this way.","18":"The next day as we were being violently tossed by the storm, they began to jettison the cargo;","19":"and on the third day they threw the ship’s tackle overboard with their own hands.","20":"Since neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small storm was assailing us, from then on all hope of our being saved was slowly abandoned.","21":"When many had lost their appetites, Paul then stood among them and said, “Men, you should have followed my advice and not have set sail from Crete, and thereby spared yourselves this damage and loss.","22":"“And yet now I urge you to keep up your courage, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.","23":"“For this very night an angel of the God to whom I belong, whom I also serve, came to me,","24":"saying, ‘Do not be afraid, Paul; you must stand before Caesar; and behold, God has graciously granted you all those who are sailing with you.’","25":"“Therefore, keep up your courage, men, for I believe God that it will turn out exactly as I have been told.","26":"“But we must run aground on a certain island.”","27":"But when the fourteenth night came, as we were being driven about in the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors began to suspect that they were approaching some land.","28":"And they took soundings and found it to be twenty fathoms; and a little farther on they took another sounding and found it to be fifteen fathoms.","29":"Fearing that we might run aground somewhere on the rocks, they cast four anchors from the stern and prayed for daybreak.","30":"But as the sailors were trying to escape from the ship and had let down the ship’s boat into the sea, on the pretense that they were going to lay out anchors from the bow,","31":"Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, “Unless these men remain on the ship, you yourselves cannot be saved.”","32":"Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the ship’s boat and let it fall away.","33":"Until the day was about to dawn, Paul kept encouraging them all to take some food, saying, “Today is the fourteenth day that you have been constantly watching and going without eating, having taken in nothing.","34":"“Therefore, I encourage you to take some food, for this is for your survival, for not a hair from the head of any of you will perish.”","35":"Having said this, he took bread and gave thanks to God in the presence of them all, and he broke it and began to eat.","36":"All of them were encouraged and they themselves also took food.","37":"We were 276 people on the ship in all.","38":"When they had eaten enough, they began lightening the ship by throwing the wheat out into the sea.","39":"Now when day came, they could not recognize the land; but they did notice a bay with a beach, and they resolved to run the ship onto it if they could.","40":"And casting off the anchors, they left them in the sea while at the same time they were loosening the ropes of the rudders; and they hoisted the foresail to the wind and were heading for the beach.","41":"But they struck a reef where two seas met and ran the ship aground; and the prow stuck firmly and remained immovable, while the stern started to break up due to the force of the waves.","42":"The soldiers’ plan was to kill the prisoners, so that none of them would swim away and escape;","43":"but the centurion, wanting to bring Paul safely through, kept them from accomplishing their intention, and commanded that those who could swim were to jump overboard first and get to land,","44":"and the rest were to follow, some on planks, and others on various things from the ship. And so it happened that they all were brought safely to land."},"28":{"1":"When they had been brought safely through, then we found out that the island was called Malta.","2":"The natives showed us extraordinary kindness, for they kindled a fire and took us all in because of the rain that had started and because of the cold.","3":"But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat and fastened itself on his hand.","4":"When the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand, they began saying to one another, “Undoubtedly this man is a murderer, and though he has been saved from the sea, justice has not allowed him to live.”","5":"However, Paul shook the creature off into the fire and suffered no harm.","6":"Now they were expecting that he was going to swell up or suddenly fall down dead. But after they had waited a long time and had seen nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and began to say that he was a god.","7":"Now in the neighboring parts of that place were lands belonging to the leading man of the island, named Publius, who welcomed us and entertained us warmly for three days.","8":"And it happened that the father of Publius was lying in bed afflicted with a recurring fever and dysentery. Paul went in to see him, and after he prayed, he laid his hands on him and healed him.","9":"After this happened, the rest of the people on the island who had diseases were coming to him and being cured.","10":"They also showed us many honors, and when we were about to set sail, they supplied us with everything we needed.","11":"After three months we set sail on an Alexandrian ship which had wintered at the island, and which had the Twin Brothers for its figurehead.","12":"After we put in at Syracuse, we stayed there for three days.","13":"From there we sailed around and arrived at Rhegium, and a day later a south wind came up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli.","14":"There we found some brothers and sisters, and were invited to stay with them for seven days; and that is how we came to Rome.","15":"And from there the brothers and sisters, when they heard about us, came as far as the Market of Appius and the Three Inns to meet us; and when Paul saw them, he thanked God and took courage.","16":"When we entered Rome, Paul was allowed to stay by himself, with the soldier who was guarding him.","17":"After three days Paul called together those who were the leading men of the Jews, and when they came together, he began saying to them, “Brothers, though I had done nothing against our people or the customs of our fathers, yet I was handed over to the Romans as a prisoner from Jerusalem.","18":"“And when they had examined me, they were willing to release me because there were no grounds for putting me to death.","19":"“But when the Jews objected, I was forced to appeal to Caesar, not that I had any accusation against my nation.","20":"“For this reason, therefore, I requested to see you and to speak with you, since I am wearing this chain for the sake of the hope of Israel.”","21":"They said to him, “We have neither received letters from Judea concerning you, nor has any of the brothers come here and reported or spoken anything bad about you.","22":"“But we desire to hear from you what your views are; for regarding this sect, it is known to us that it is spoken against everywhere.”","23":"When they had set a day for Paul, people came to him at his lodging in large numbers; and he was explaining to them by solemnly testifying about the kingdom of God and trying to persuade them concerning Jesus, from both the Law of Moses and from the Prophets, from morning until evening.","24":"Some were being persuaded by the things said by Paul, but others would not believe.","25":"And when they disagreed with one another, they began leaving after Paul said one parting statement: “The Holy Spirit rightly spoke through Isaiah the prophet to your fathers,","26":"saying,\n‘GO TO THIS PEOPLE AND SAY,\n“YOU WILL KEEP ON HEARING, AND WILL NOT UNDERSTAND;\nAND YOU WILL KEEP ON SEEING, AND WILL NOT PERCEIVE;","27":"FOR THE HEARTS OF THIS PEOPLE HAVE BECOME INSENSITIVE,\nAND WITH THEIR EARS THEY HARDLY HEAR,\nAND THEY HAVE CLOSED THEIR EYES;\nOTHERWISE THEY MIGHT SEE WITH THEIR EYES,\nAND HEAR WITH THEIR EARS,\nAND UNDERSTAND WITH THEIR HEART AND RETURN,\nAND I WOULD HEAL THEM.”’","28":"“Therefore, let it be known to you that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles;

And He will yet deliver us,","11":"if you also join in helping us through your prayers, so that thanks may be given by many persons in our behalf for the favor granted to us through the prayers of many.","12":"For our proud confidence is this: the testimony of our conscience, that in holiness and godly sincerity, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially toward you.","13":"For we write nothing else to you than what you read and understand, and I hope you will understand until the end;","14":"just as you also partially did understand us, that we are your reason to be proud as you also are ours, on the day of our Lord Jesus.","15":"In this confidence I intended at first to come to you, so that you might twice receive a blessing;","16":"that is, to pass your way into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come to you, and by you to be helped on my journey to Judea.","17":"Therefore, I was not vacillating when I intended to do this, was I? Or what I decide, do I decide according to the flesh, so that with me there will be yes, yes and no, no at the same time?","18":"But as God is faithful, our word to you is not yes and no.","19":"For the Son of God, Christ Jesus, who was preached among you by us—by me and Silvanus and Timothy—was not yes and no, but has been yes in Him.","20":"For as many as the promises of God are, in Him they are yes; therefore through Him also is our Amen to the glory of God through us.","21":"Now He who establishes us with you in Christ and anointed us is God,","22":"who also sealed us and gave us the Spirit in our hearts as a pledge.","23":"But I call God as witness to my soul, that it was to spare you that I did not come again to Corinth.","24":"Not that we domineer over your faith, but we are workers with you for your joy; for in your faith you are standing firm."},"2":{"1":"But I decided this for my own sake, that I would not come to you in sorrow again.","2":"For if I cause you sorrow, who then will be the one making me glad but the one who is made sorrowful by me?","3":"This is the very thing I wrote you, so that when I came, I would not have sorrow from those who ought to make me rejoice; having confidence in you all that my joy was the joy of you all.","4":"For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears; not so that you would be made sorrowful, but that you might know the love which I have especially for you.","5":"But if anyone has caused sorrow, he has caused sorrow not for me, but in some degree—not to say too much—for all of you.","6":"Sufficient for such a person is this punishment which was imposed by the majority,","7":"so that on the other hand, you should rather forgive and comfort him, otherwise such a person might be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.","8":"Therefore I urge you to reaffirm your love for him.","9":"For to this end I also wrote, so that I might put you to the test, whether you are obedient in all things.","10":"But one whom you forgive anything, I also forgive; for indeed what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, I did so for your sakes in the presence of Christ,","11":"so that no advantage would be taken of us by Satan, for we are not ignorant of his schemes.","12":"Now when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ and when a door was opened for me in the Lord,","13":"I had no rest for my spirit, not finding Titus my brother; but saying goodbye to them, I went on to Macedonia.","14":"But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and through us reveals the fragrance of the knowledge of Him in every place.","15":"For we are a fragrance of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing:","16":"to the one an aroma from death to death, to the other an aroma from life to life. And who is adequate for these things?","17":"For we are not like the many, peddling the word of God, but as from sincerity, but as from God, we speak in Christ in the sight of God."},"3":{"1":"Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, as some, letters of commendation to you or from you?","2":"You are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read by all people,","3":"revealing yourselves, that you are a letter of Christ, delivered by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.","4":"Such is the confidence we have toward God through Christ.","5":"Not that we are adequate in ourselves so as to consider anything as having come from ourselves, but our adequacy is from God,","6":"who also made us adequate as servants of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.","7":"But if the ministry of death, engraved in letters on stones, came with glory so that the sons of Israel could not look intently at the face of Moses because of the glory of his face, fading as it was,","8":"how will the ministry of the Spirit fail to be even more with glory?","9":"For if the ministry of condemnation has glory, much more does the ministry of righteousness excel in glory.","10":"For indeed what had glory in this case has no glory, because of the glory that surpasses it.","11":"For if that which fades away was with glory, much more that which remains is in glory.","12":"Therefore, having such a hope, we use great boldness in our speech,","13":"and we are not like Moses, who used to put a veil over his face so that the sons of Israel would not stare at the end of what was fading away.","14":"But their minds were hardened; for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remains unlifted, because it is removed in Christ.","15":"But to this day whenever Moses is read, a veil lies over their hearts;","16":"but whenever someone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.","17":"Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.","18":"But we all, with unveiled faces, looking as in a mirror at the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as from the Lord, the Spirit."},"4":{"1":"Therefore, since we have this ministry, as we received mercy, we do not lose heart,","2":"but we have renounced the things hidden because of shame, not walking in trickery nor distorting the word of God, but by the open proclamation of the truth commending ourselves to every person’s conscience in the sight of God.","3":"And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing,","4":"in whose case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving so that they will not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.","5":"For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your bond-servants on account of Jesus.","6":"For God, who said, “Light shall shine out of darkness,” is the One who has shone in our hearts to give the Light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.","7":"But we have this treasure in earthen containers, so that the extraordinary greatness of the power will be of God and not from ourselves;","8":"we are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not despairing;","9":"persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed;","10":"always carrying around in the body the dying of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body.","11":"For we who live are constantly being handed over to death because of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our mortal flesh.","12":"So death works in us, but life in you.","13":"But having the same spirit of faith, according to what is written: “I BELIEVED, THEREFORE I SPOKE,” we also believe, therefore we also speak,","14":"knowing that He who raised the Lord Jesus will also raise us with Jesus, and will present us with you.","15":"For all things are for your sakes, so that grace, having spread to more and more people, will cause thanksgiving to overflow to the glory of God.","16":"Therefore we do not lose heart, but though our outer person is decaying, yet our inner person is being renewed day by day.","17":"For our momentary, light affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison,","18":"while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal."},"5":{"1":"For we know that if our earthly tent which is our house is torn down, we have a building from God, a house not made by hands, eternal in the heavens.","2":"For indeed, in this tent we groan, longing to be clothed with our dwelling from heaven,","3":"since in fact after putting it on, we will not be found naked.","4":"For indeed, we who are in this tent groan, being burdened, because we do not want to be unclothed but to be clothed, so that what is mortal will be swallowed up by life.","5":"Now He who prepared us for this very purpose is God, who gave us the Spirit as a pledge.","6":"Therefore, being always of good courage, and knowing that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord—","7":"for we walk by faith, not by sight—","8":"but we are of good courage and prefer rather to be absent from the body and to be at home with the Lord.","9":"Therefore we also have as our ambition, whether at home or absent, to be pleasing to Him.","10":"For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive compensation for his deeds done through the body, in accordance with what he has done, whether good or bad.","11":"Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade people, but we are well known to God; and I hope that we are also well known in your consciences.","12":"We are not commending ourselves to you again, but are giving you an opportunity to be proud of us, so that you will have an answer for those who take pride in appearance and not in heart.","13":"For if we have lost our minds, it is for God; if we are of sound mind, it is for you.","14":"For the love of Christ controls us, having concluded this, that one died for all, therefore all died;","15":"and He died for all, so that those who live would no longer live for themselves, but for Him who died and rose on their behalf.","16":"Therefore from now on we recognize no one by the flesh; even though we have known Christ by the flesh, yet now we know Him in this way no longer.","17":"Therefore if anyone is in Christ, this person is a new creation; the old things passed away; behold, new things have come.","18":"Now all these things are from God, who reconciled us to Himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation,","19":"namely, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not counting their wrongdoings against them, and He has committed to us the word of reconciliation.","20":"Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were making an appeal through us; we beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.","21":"He made Him who knew no sin to be sin in our behalf, so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him."},"6":{"1":"And working together with Him, we also urge you not to receive the grace of God in vain—","2":"for He says,\n“AT A FAVORABLE TIME I LISTENED TO YOU,\nAND ON A DAY OF SALVATION I HELPED YOU.”\nBehold, now is “A FAVORABLE TIME,” behold, now is “A DAY OF SALVATION”—","3":"giving no reason for taking offense in anything, so that the ministry will not be discredited,","4":"but in everything commending ourselves as servants of God, in much endurance, in afflictions, in hardships, in difficulties,","5":"in beatings, in imprisonments, in mob attacks, in labors, in sleeplessness, in hunger,","6":"in purity, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in genuine love,","7":"in the word of truth, and in the power of God; by the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and the left,","8":"by glory and dishonor, by evil report and good report; regarded as deceivers and yet true;","9":"as unknown and yet well known, as dying and yet behold, we are alive; as punished and yet not put to death,","10":"as sorrowful yet always rejoicing, as poor yet making many rich, as having nothing and yet possessing all things.","11":"Our mouth has spoken freely to you, you Corinthians, our heart is opened wide.","12":"You are not restrained by us, but you are restrained in your own affections.","13":"Now in the same way in exchange—I am speaking as to children—open wide your hearts to us, you as well.","14":"Do not be mismatched with unbelievers; for what do righteousness and lawlessness share together, or what does light have in common with darkness?","15":"Or what harmony does Christ have with Belial, or what does a believer share with an unbeliever?","16":"Or what agreement does the temple of God have with idols?

I am filled with comfort; I am overflowing with joy in all our affliction.","5":"For even when we came into Macedonia our flesh had no rest, but we were afflicted on every side: conflicts on the outside, fears inside.","6":"But God, who comforts the discouraged, comforted us by the arrival of Titus;","7":"and not only by his arrival, but also by the comfort with which he was comforted among you, as he reported to us your longing, your mourning, your zeal for me; so that I rejoiced even more.","8":"For though I caused you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it; though I did regret it—for I see that that letter caused you sorrow, though only for a while—","9":"I now rejoice, not that you were made sorrowful, but that you were made sorrowful to the point of repentance; for you were made sorrowful according to the will of God, so that you might not suffer loss in anything through us.","10":"For the sorrow that is according to the will of God produces a repentance without regret, leading to salvation, but the sorrow of the world produces death.","11":"For behold what earnestness this very thing, this godly sorrow, has produced in you: what vindication of yourselves, what indignation, what fear, what longing, what zeal, what punishment of wrong! In everything you demonstrated yourselves to be innocent in the matter.","12":"So although I wrote to you, it was not for the sake of the offender nor for the sake of the one offended, but that your earnestness in our behalf might be made known to you in the sight of God.","13":"Because of this, we have been comforted.\nAnd besides our comfort, we rejoiced even much more for the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all.","14":"For if I have boasted to him about you regarding anything, I was not put to shame. But as we spoke all things to you in truth, so also our boasting before Titus proved to be the truth.","15":"His affection abounds all the more toward you, as he remembers the obedience of you all, how you received him with fear and trembling.","16":"I rejoice that in everything I have confidence in you."},"8":{"1":"Now, brothers and sisters, we make known to you the grace of God which has been given in the churches of Macedonia,","2":"that in a great ordeal of affliction their abundance of joy and their deep poverty overflowed in the wealth of their liberality.","3":"For I testify that according to their ability, and beyond their ability, they gave voluntarily,","4":"begging us with much urging for the favor of participation in the support of the saints,","5":"and this, not as we had expected, but they first gave themselves to the Lord and to us by the will of God.","6":"So we urged Titus that as he had previously made a beginning, so he would also complete in you this gracious work as well.","7":"But just as you excel in everything, in faith, speaking, knowledge, and in all earnestness and in the love we inspired in you, see that you also excel in this gracious work.","8":"I am not saying this as a command, but as proving, through the earnestness of others, the sincerity of your love as well.","9":"For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sake He became poor, so that you through His poverty might become rich.","10":"I give my opinion in this matter, for this is to your advantage, who were the first to begin a year ago not only to do this, but also to desire to do it.","11":"But now finish doing it also, so that just as there was the willingness to desire it, so there may be also the completion of it by your ability.","12":"For if the willingness is present, it is acceptable according to what a person has, not according to what he does not have.","13":"For this is not for the relief of others and for your hardship, but by way of equality—","14":"at this present time your abundance will serve as assistance for their need, so that their abundance also may serve as assistance for your need, so that there may be equality;","15":"as it is written: “THE ONE WHO HAD GATHERED MUCH DID NOT HAVE TOO MUCH, AND THE ONE WHO HAD GATHERED LITTLE DID NOT HAVE TOO LITTLE.”","16":"But thanks be to God who puts the same earnestness in your behalf in the heart of Titus.","17":"For he not only accepted our appeal, but being himself very earnest, he has gone to you of his own accord.","18":"We have sent along with him the brother whose fame in the things of the gospel has spread through all the churches;","19":"and not only that, but he has also been appointed by the churches to travel with us in this gracious work, which is being administered by us for the glory of the Lord Himself, and to show our readiness,","20":"taking precaution so that no one will discredit us in our administration of this generous gift;","21":"for we have regard for what is honorable, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of other people.","22":"We have sent with them our brother, whom we have often tested and found diligent in many things, but now even more diligent because of his great confidence in you.","23":"As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker among you;

But now we do not yet see all things subjected to him.","9":"But we do see Him who was made for a little while lower than the angels, namely, Jesus, because of His suffering death crowned with glory and honor, so that by the grace of God He might taste death for everyone.","10":"For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to perfect the originator of their salvation through sufferings.","11":"For both He who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from one Father; for this reason He is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters,","12":"saying,\n“I WILL PROCLAIM YOUR NAME TO MY BROTHERS,\nIN THE MIDST OF THE ASSEMBLY I WILL SING YOUR PRAISE.”","13":"And again,\n“I WILL PUT MY TRUST IN HIM.”\nAnd again,\n“BEHOLD, I AND THE CHILDREN WHOM GOD HAS GIVEN ME.”","14":"Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood, He Himself likewise also partook of the same, so that through death He might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil,","15":"and free those who through fear of death were subject to slavery all their lives.","16":"For clearly He does not give help to angels, but He gives help to the descendants of Abraham.","17":"Therefore, in all things He had to be made like His brothers so that He might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.","18":"For since He Himself was tempted in that which He has suffered, He is able to come to the aid of those who are tempted."},"3":{"1":"Therefore, holy brothers and sisters, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession: Jesus;","2":"He was faithful to Him who appointed Him, as Moses also was in all His house.","3":"For He has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by just so much as the builder of the house has more honor than the house.","4":"For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.","5":"Now Moses was faithful in all God’s house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken later;","6":"but Christ was faithful as a Son over His house—whose house we are, if we hold firmly to our confidence and the boast of our hope.","7":"Therefore, just as the Holy Spirit says,\n“TODAY IF YOU HEAR HIS VOICE,","8":"DO NOT HARDEN YOUR HEARTS AS WHEN THEY PROVOKED ME,\nAS ON THE DAY OF TRIAL IN THE WILDERNESS,","9":"WHERE YOUR FATHERS PUT ME TO THE TEST,\nAND SAW MY WORKS FOR FORTY YEARS.","10":"“THEREFORE I WAS ANGRY WITH THIS GENERATION,\nAND SAID, ‘THEY ALWAYS GO ASTRAY IN THEIR HEART,\nAND THEY DID NOT KNOW MY WAYS’;","11":"AS I SWORE IN MY ANGER,\n‘THEY CERTAINLY SHALL NOT ENTER MY REST.’”","12":"Take care, brothers and sisters, that there will not be in any one of you an evil, unbelieving heart that falls away from the living God.","13":"But encourage one another every day, as long as it is still called “today,” so that none of you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.","14":"For we have become partakers of Christ if we keep the beginning of our commitment firm until the end,","15":"while it is said,\n“TODAY IF YOU HEAR HIS VOICE,\nDO NOT HARDEN YOUR HEARTS, AS WHEN THEY PROVOKED ME.”","16":"For who provoked Him when they had heard? Indeed, did not all those who came out of Egypt led by Moses?","17":"And with whom was He angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose dead bodies fell in the wilderness?","18":"And to whom did He swear that they would not enter His rest, but to those who were disobedient?","19":"And so we see that they were not able to enter because of unbelief."},"4":{"1":"Therefore, we must fear if, while a promise remains of entering His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short of it.","2":"For indeed we have had good news preached to us, just as they also did; but the word they heard did not benefit them, because they were not united with those who listened with faith.","3":"For we who have believed enter that rest, just as He has said,\n“AS I SWORE IN MY ANGER,\nTHEY CERTAINLY SHALL NOT ENTER MY REST,”\nalthough His works were finished from the foundation of the world.","4":"For He has said somewhere concerning the seventh day: “AND GOD RESTED ON THE SEVENTH DAY FROM ALL HIS WORKS”;","5":"and again in this passage, “THEY CERTAINLY SHALL NOT ENTER MY REST.”","6":"Therefore, since it remains for some to enter it, and those who previously had good news preached to them failed to enter because of disobedience,","7":"He again sets a certain day, “Today,” saying through David after so long a time just as has been said before,\n“TODAY IF YOU HEAR HIS VOICE,\nDO NOT HARDEN YOUR HEARTS.”","8":"For if Joshua had given them rest, He would not have spoken of another day after that.","9":"Consequently, there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God.","10":"For the one who has entered His rest has himself also rested from his works, as God did from His.","11":"Therefore let’s make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will fall by following the same example of disobedience.","12":"For the word of God is living and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, even penetrating as far as the division of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.","13":"And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are open and laid bare to the eyes of Him to whom we must answer.","14":"Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let’s hold firmly to our confession.","15":"For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things just as we are, yet without sin.","16":"Therefore let’s approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace for help at the time of our need."},"5":{"1":"For every high priest taken from among men is appointed on behalf of people in things pertaining to God, in order to offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins;","2":"he can deal gently with the ignorant and misguided, since he himself also is clothed in weakness;","3":"and because of it he is obligated to offer sacrifices for sins for himself, as well as for the people.","4":"And no one takes the honor for himself, but receives it when he is called by God, just as Aaron also was.","5":"So too Christ did not glorify Himself in becoming a high priest, but it was He who said to Him,\n“YOU ARE MY SON,\nTODAY I HAVE FATHERED YOU”;","6":"just as He also says in another passage,\n“YOU ARE A PRIEST FOREVER\nACCORDING TO THE ORDER OF MELCHIZEDEK.”","7":"In the days of His humanity, He offered up both prayers and pleas with loud crying and tears to the One able to save Him from death, and He was heard because of His devout behavior.","8":"Although He was a Son, He learned obedience from the things which He suffered.","9":"And having been perfected, He became the source of eternal salvation for all those who obey Him,","10":"being designated by God as High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek.","11":"Concerning him we have much to say, and it is difficult to explain, since you have become poor listeners.","12":"For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you have need again for someone to teach you the elementary principles of the actual words of God, and you have come to need milk and not solid food.","13":"For everyone who partakes only of milk is unacquainted with the word of righteousness, for he is an infant.","14":"But solid food is for the mature, who because of practice have their senses trained to distinguish between good and evil."},"6":{"1":"Therefore leaving the elementary teaching about the Christ, let us press on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God,","2":"of instruction about washings and laying on of hands, and about the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment.","3":"And this we will do, if God permits.","4":"For it is impossible, in the case of those who have once been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit,","5":"and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come,","6":"and then have fallen away, to restore them again to repentance, since they again crucify to themselves the Son of God and put Him to open shame.","7":"For ground that drinks the rain which often falls on it and produces vegetation useful to those for whose sake it is also tilled, receives a blessing from God;","8":"but if it yields thorns and thistles, it is worthless and close to being cursed, and it ends up being burned.","9":"But, beloved, we are convinced of better things regarding you, and things that accompany salvation, even though we are speaking in this way.","10":"For God is not unjust so as to forget your work and the love which you have shown toward His name, by having served and by still serving the saints.","11":"And we desire that each one of you demonstrate the same diligence so as to realize the full assurance of hope until the end,","12":"so that you will not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and endurance inherit the promises.","13":"For when God made the promise to Abraham, since He could swear an oath by no one greater, He swore by Himself,","14":"saying, “INDEED I WILL GREATLY BLESS YOU AND I WILL GREATLY MULTIPLY YOU.”","15":"And so, having patiently waited, he obtained the promise.","16":"For people swear an oath by one greater than themselves, and with them an oath serving as confirmation is an end of every dispute.","17":"In the same way God, desiring even more to demonstrate to the heirs of the promise the fact that His purpose is unchangeable, confirmed it with an oath,","18":"so that by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have taken refuge would have strong encouragement to hold firmly to the hope set before us.","19":"This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, a hope both sure and reliable and one which enters within the veil,","20":"where Jesus has entered as a forerunner for us, having become a high priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek."},"7":{"1":"For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham as he was returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,","2":"to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth of all the spoils, was first of all, by the translation of his name, king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, which is king of peace.","3":"Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, he remains a priest perpetually.","4":"Now observe how great this man was to whom Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth of the choicest spoils.","5":"And those indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest’s office have a commandment in the Law to collect a tenth from the people, that is, from their countrymen, although they are descended from Abraham.","6":"But the one whose genealogy is not traced from them collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed the one who had the promises.","7":"But without any dispute the lesser person is blessed by the greater.","8":"In this case mortal men receive tithes, but in that case one receives them, of whom it is witnessed that he lives on.","9":"And, so to speak, through Abraham even Levi, who received tithes, has paid tithes,","10":"for he was still in the loins of his forefather when Melchizedek met him.","11":"So if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood (for on the basis of it the people received the Law), what further need was there for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek, and not be designated according to the order of Aaron?","12":"For when the priesthood is changed, of necessity there takes place a change of law also.","13":"For the one about whom these things are said belongs to another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar.","14":"For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, a tribe with reference to which Moses said nothing concerning priests.","15":"And this is clearer still, if another priest arises according to the likeness of Melchizedek,","16":"who has become a priest not on the basis of a law of physical requirement, but according to the power of an indestructible life.","17":"For it is attested of Him,\n“YOU ARE A PRIEST FOREVER\nACCORDING TO THE ORDER OF MELCHIZEDEK.”","18":"For, on the one hand, there is the nullification of a former commandment because of its weakness and uselessness","19":"(for the Law made nothing perfect); on the other hand, there is the introduction of a better hope, through which we come near to God.","20":"And to the extent that it was not without an oath","21":"(for they indeed became priests without an oath, but He with an oath through the One who said to Him,\n“THE LORD HAS SWORN\nAND WILL NOT CHANGE HIS MIND,\n‘YOU ARE A PRIEST FOREVER’”);","22":"by the same extent Jesus also has become the guarantee of a better covenant.","23":"The former priests, on the one hand, existed in greater numbers because they were prevented by death from continuing;","24":"Jesus, on the other hand, because He continues forever, holds His priesthood permanently.","25":"Therefore He is also able to save forever those who come to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them.","26":"For it was fitting for us to have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens;","27":"who has no daily need, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for His own sins and then for the sins of the people, because He did this once for all time when He offered up Himself.","28":"For the Law appoints men as high priests who are weak, but the word of the oath, which came after the Law, appoints a Son, who has been made perfect forever."},"8":{"1":"Now the main point in what has been said is this: we have such a high priest, who has taken His seat at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,","2":"a minister in the sanctuary and in the true tabernacle, which the Lord set up, not man.","3":"For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices; so it is necessary that this high priest also have something to offer.","4":"Now if He were on earth, He would not be a priest at all, since there are those who offer the gifts according to the Law;","5":"who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, just as Moses was warned by God when he was about to erect the tabernacle; for, “SEE,” He says, “THAT YOU MAKE all things BY THE PATTERN WHICH WAS SHOWN TO YOU ON THE MOUNTAIN.”","6":"But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry, to the extent that He is also the mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted on better promises.","7":"For if that first covenant had been free of fault, no circumstances would have been sought for a second.","8":"For in finding fault with the people, He says,\n“BEHOLD, DAYS ARE COMING, SAYS THE LORD,\nWHEN I WILL BRING ABOUT A NEW COVENANT\nWITH THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL AND THE HOUSE OF JUDAH,","9":"NOT LIKE THE COVENANT WHICH I MADE WITH THEIR FATHERS\nON THE DAY I TOOK THEM BY THE HAND\nTO BRING THEM OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT;\nFOR THEY DID NOT CONTINUE IN MY COVENANT,\nAND I DID NOT CARE ABOUT THEM, SAYS THE LORD.","10":"“FOR THIS IS THE COVENANT WHICH I WILL MAKE WITH THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL\nAFTER THOSE DAYS, DECLARES THE LORD:\nI WILL PUT MY LAWS INTO THEIR MINDS,\nAND WRITE THEM ON THEIR HEARTS.\nAND I WILL BE THEIR GOD,\nAND THEY SHALL BE MY PEOPLE.","11":"“AND THEY WILL NOT TEACH, EACH ONE HIS FELLOW CITIZEN,\nAND EACH ONE HIS BROTHER, SAYING, ‘KNOW THE LORD,’\nFOR THEY WILL ALL KNOW ME,\nFROM THE LEAST TO THE GREATEST OF THEM.","12":"“FOR I WILL BE MERCIFUL TOWARD THEIR WRONGDOINGS,\nAND THEIR SINS I WILL NO LONGER REMEMBER.”","13":"When He said, “A new covenant,” He has made the first obsolete. But whatever is becoming obsolete and growing old is about to disappear."},"9":{"1":"Now even the first covenant had regulations for divine worship and the earthly sanctuary.","2":"For a tabernacle was equipped, the outer sanctuary, in which were the lampstand, the table, and the sacred bread; this is called the Holy Place.","3":"Behind the second veil there was a tabernacle which is called the Most Holy Place,","4":"having a golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold, in which was a golden jar holding the manna, Aaron’s staff which budded, and the tablets of the covenant;","5":"and above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the atoning cover; but about these things we cannot now speak in detail.","6":"Now when these things have been so prepared, the priests are continually entering the outer tabernacle, performing the divine worship,","7":"but into the second, only the high priest enters once a year, not without taking blood which he offers for himself and for the sins of the people committed in ignorance.","8":"The Holy Spirit is signifying this, that the way into the holy place has not yet been disclosed while the outer tabernacle is still standing,","9":"which is a symbol for the present time. Accordingly both gifts and sacrifices are offered which cannot make the worshiper perfect in conscience,","10":"since they relate only to food, drink, and various washings, regulations for the body imposed until a time of reformation.","11":"But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things having come, He entered through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made by hands, that is, not of this creation;","12":"and not through the blood of goats and calves, but through His own blood, He entered the holy place once for all time, having obtained eternal redemption.","13":"For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled, sanctify for the cleansing of the flesh,","14":"how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?","15":"For this reason He is the mediator of a new covenant, so that, since a death has taken place for the redemption of the violations that were committed under the first covenant, those who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.","16":"For where there is a covenant, there must of necessity be the death of the one who made it.","17":"For a covenant is valid only when people are dead, for it is never in force while the one who made it lives.","18":"Therefore even the first covenant was not inaugurated without blood.","19":"For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the Law, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,","20":"saying, “THIS IS THE BLOOD OF THE COVENANT WHICH GOD COMMANDED YOU.”","21":"And in the same way he sprinkled both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry with the blood.","22":"And almost all things are cleansed with blood, according to the Law, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.","23":"Therefore it was necessary for the copies of the things in the heavens to be cleansed with these things, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.","24":"For Christ did not enter a holy place made by hands, a mere copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us;","25":"nor was it that He would offer Himself often, as the high priest enters the Holy Place year by year with blood that is not his own.","26":"Otherwise, He would have needed to suffer often since the foundation of the world; but now once at the consummation of the ages He has been revealed to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself.","27":"And just as it is destined for people to die once, and after this comes judgment,","28":"so Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time for salvation without reference to sin, to those who eagerly await Him."},"10":{"1":"For the Law, since it has only a shadow of the good things to come and not the form of those things itself, can never, by the same sacrifices which they offer continually every year, make those who approach perfect.","2":"Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, because the worshipers, having once been cleansed, would no longer have had consciousness of sins?","3":"But in those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins every year.","4":"For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.","5":"Therefore, when He comes into the world, He says,\n“YOU HAVE NOT DESIRED SACRIFICE AND OFFERING,\nBUT YOU HAVE PREPARED A BODY FOR ME;","6":"YOU HAVE NOT TAKEN PLEASURE IN WHOLE BURNT OFFERINGS AND OFFERINGS FOR SIN.","7":"“THEN I SAID, ‘BEHOLD, I HAVE COME\n(IT IS WRITTEN OF ME IN THE SCROLL OF THE BOOK)\nTO DO YOUR WILL, O GOD.’”","8":"After saying above, “SACRIFICES AND OFFERINGS AND WHOLE BURNT OFFERINGS AND OFFERINGS FOR SIN YOU HAVE NOT DESIRED, NOR HAVE YOU TAKEN PLEASURE IN THEM” (which are offered according to the Law),","9":"then He said, “BEHOLD, I HAVE COME TO DO YOUR WILL.” He takes away the first in order to establish the second.","10":"By this will, we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all time.","11":"Every priest stands daily ministering and offering time after time the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins;","12":"but He, having offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, SAT DOWN AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD,","13":"waiting from that time onward UNTIL HIS ENEMIES ARE MADE A FOOTSTOOL FOR HIS FEET.","14":"For by one offering He has perfected for all time those who are sanctified.","15":"And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us; for after saying,","16":"“THIS IS THE COVENANT WHICH I WILL MAKE WITH THEM\nAFTER THOSE DAYS, DECLARES THE LORD:\nI WILL PUT MY LAWS UPON THEIR HEARTS,\nAND WRITE THEM ON THEIR MIND,”\nHe then says,","17":"“AND THEIR SINS AND THEIR LAWLESS DEEDS\nI WILL NO LONGER REMEMBER.”","18":"Now where there is forgiveness of these things, an offering for sin is no longer required.","19":"Therefore, brothers and sisters, since we have confidence to enter the holy place by the blood of Jesus,","20":"by a new and living way which He inaugurated for us through the veil, that is, through His flesh,","21":"and since we have a great priest over the house of God,","22":"let’s approach God with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.","23":"Let’s hold firmly to the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful;","24":"and let’s consider how to encourage one another in love and good deeds,","25":"not abandoning our own meeting together, as is the habit of some people, but encouraging one another; and all the more as you see the day drawing near.","26":"For if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,","27":"but a terrifying expectation of judgment and THE FURY OF A FIRE WHICH WILL CONSUME THE ADVERSARIES.","28":"Anyone who has ignored the Law of Moses is put to death without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.","29":"How much more severe punishment do you think he will deserve who has trampled underfoot the Son of God, and has regarded as unclean the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?","30":"For we know Him who said, “VENGEANCE IS MINE, I WILL REPAY.” And again, “THE LORD WILL JUDGE HIS PEOPLE.”","31":"It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God.","32":"But remember the former days, when, after being enlightened, you endured a great conflict of sufferings,","33":"partly by being made a public spectacle through insults and distress, and partly by becoming companions with those who were so treated.","34":"For you showed sympathy to the prisoners and accepted joyfully the seizure of your property, knowing that you have for yourselves a better and lasting possession.","35":"Therefore, do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward.","36":"For you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God, you may receive what was promised.","37":"FOR YET IN A VERY LITTLE WHILE,\nHE WHO IS COMING WILL COME, AND WILL NOT DELAY.","38":"BUT MY RIGHTEOUS ONE WILL LIVE BY FAITH;\nAND IF HE SHRINKS BACK, MY SOUL HAS NO PLEASURE IN HIM.","39":"But we are not among those who shrink back to destruction, but of those who have faith for the safekeeping of the soul."},"11":{"1":"Now faith is the certainty of things hoped for, a proof of things not seen.","2":"For by it the people of old gained approval.","3":"By faith we understand that the world has been created by the word of God so that what is seen has not been made out of things that are visible.","4":"By faith Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain, through which he was attested to be righteous, God testifying about his gifts, and through faith, though he is dead, he still speaks.","5":"By faith Enoch was taken up so that he would not see death; AND HE WAS NOT FOUND BECAUSE GOD TOOK HIM UP; for before he was taken up, he was attested to have been pleasing to God.","6":"And without faith it is impossible to please Him, for the one who comes to God must believe that He exists, and that He proves to be One who rewards those who seek Him.","7":"By faith Noah, being warned by God about things not yet seen, in reverence prepared an ark for the salvation of his household, by which he condemned the world, and became an heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.","8":"By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance;

I will give water to the one who thirsts from the spring of the water of life, without cost.","7":"“The one who overcomes will inherit these things, and I will be his God and he will be My son.","8":"“But for the cowardly, and unbelieving, and abominable, and murderers, and sexually immoral persons, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, their part will be in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.”","9":"Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls, full of the seven last plagues, came and spoke with me, saying, “Come here, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.”","10":"And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,","11":"having the glory of God. Her brilliance was like a very valuable stone, like a stone of crystal-clear jasper.","12":"It had a great and high wall, with twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels; and names were written on the gates, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel.","13":"There were three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west.","14":"And the wall of the city had twelve foundation stones, and on them were the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.","15":"The one who spoke with me had a gold measuring rod to measure the city, its gates, and its wall.","16":"The city is laid out as a square, and its length is as great as the width; and he measured the city with the rod, twelve thousand stadia; its length, width, and height are equal.","17":"And he measured its wall, 144 cubits, by human measurements, which are also angelic measurements.","18":"The material of the wall was jasper; and the city was pure gold, like clear glass.","19":"The foundation stones of the city wall were decorated with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation stone was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;","20":"the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst.","21":"And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the gates was a single pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.","22":"I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.","23":"And the city has no need of the sun or of the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God has illuminated it, and its lamp is the Lamb.","24":"The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it.","25":"In the daytime (for there will be no night there) its gates will never be closed;","26":"and they will bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it;","27":"and nothing unclean, and no one who practices abomination and lying, shall ever come into it, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb’s book of life."},"22":{"1":"And he showed me a river of the water of life, clear as crystal, coming from the throne of God and of the Lamb,","2":"in the middle of its street. On either side of the river was the tree of life, bearing twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit every month; and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.","3":"There will no longer be any curse; and the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and His bond-servants will serve Him;","4":"they will see His face, and His name will be on their foreheads.","5":"And there will no longer be any night; and they will not have need of the light of a lamp nor the light of the sun, because the Lord God will illuminate them; and they will reign forever and ever.","6":"And he said to me, “These words are faithful and true”; and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, sent His angel to show His bond-servants the things which must soon take place.","7":"“And behold, I am coming quickly. Blessed is the one who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book.”","8":"I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. And when I heard and saw them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed me these things.","9":"And he *said to me, “Do not do that; I am a fellow servant of yours and of your brothers the prophets, and of those who keep the words of this book. Worship God!”","10":"And he *said to me, “Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near.","11":"“Let the one who does wrong still do wrong, and the one who is filthy still be filthy; and let the one who is righteous still practice righteousness, and the one who is holy still keep himself holy.”","12":"“Behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, to reward each one as his work deserves.","13":"“I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.”","14":"Blessed are those who wash their robes, so that they will have the right to the tree of life, and may enter the city by the gates.","15":"Outside are the dogs, the sorcerers, the sexually immoral persons, the murderers, the idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices lying.","16":"“I, Jesus, have sent My angel to testify to you of these things for the churches. I am the root and the descendant of David, the bright morning star.”","17":"The Spirit and the bride say, “Come.” And let the one who hears say, “Come.” And let the one who is thirsty come; let the one who desires, take the water of life without cost.","18":"I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book;","19":"and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his part from the tree of life and from the holy city, which are written in this book.","20":"He who testifies to these things says, “Yes, I am coming quickly.” Amen. Come, Lord Jesus.","21":"The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all. Amen."}}}
